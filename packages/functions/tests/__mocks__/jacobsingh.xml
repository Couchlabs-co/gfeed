Cross-functional product teams give way to matrixed shared services teams w/ and eventually to internal product orgs aka &#x201C;platform teams&#x201D;. This article will specifically focus on best practices for building platform teams.</p><p>This post (like the rest of this blog) comes from coaching sessions I do with tech leaders. This week&#x2019;s session was with <a href="https://twitter.com/dhruvbaldawa" rel>Dhruv Baldawa</a> of <a href="https://paystack.com/" rel>Paystack</a>. If you&#x2019;ve got a product engineering leadership question you&#x2019;d like to bounce around with me, I do one free one every week for this newsletter. Just<a href="https://forms.gle/wJeaoXyeM9aPdvar5" rel> fill the form</a>.</p><p>Subscribe to receive new posts weeklyish on product engineering leadership. No other emails. Max 4 a month.<strong>&#x2713;</strong></p><p>Jumping in.</p><h3 id="background">Background:</h3><ul><li>Dhruv is a Principal Engineer at Paystack, the leading African payment gateway.</li><li>The tech team is 100 people (out of 250 employees).</li><li>He will soon be leading the newly formed platform group.</li></ul><h3 id="the-question">The question:</h3><ul><li>How should we best structure the org at this scale for reliability and scalability (not just product features)?</li><li>How can I create a technical strategy that aligns to the business strategy?</li><li>What are best (and worst) practices for building a platform team?</li></ul><h3 id="session-details">Session details:</h3><p>From a CTO/Tech org lens, I like to think of the startup journey in 4 broad phases:</p><ol><li><strong>The scramble:</strong> x-functional teams purely chasing Product Market Fit (PMF) with little regard to maintenance or architecture. Optimizes for speed by doing only a few things at once and throwing everyone at the problem. High degree of flexibility and generalization (few specialists).</li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4233b354-449f-4b28-a717-2dba3dfeab01_794x530.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to start a product engineering platform team" loading="lazy"></figure><ol><li><strong>Adult supervision:</strong> Strategic alignment becomes an issue, as does quality when we scale. We start hiring specialists (e.g. mobile, QA, data engineering, etc). These specialists often are a bottleneck because multiple teams use them. Teams depends a lot on each-other (poor architectural boundaries) and we add EMs, PMs, etc to manage this &#x201C;resource utilization&#x201D; and end up with a lot of planning meetings, often Scrum or something scrumish is instituted to ensure communication happens. [ <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/india/article/start-less-finish-more/" rel>Longer post about exactly this over at Sequoia Cap</a> ]. People start coming to work just for free coffee.</li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a11c894-93f4-4747-bb68-91896d418ee6_868x1036.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to start a product engineering platform team" loading="lazy"></figure><ol><li><strong>Platform teams:</strong> The bureaucracy and slowness of the &#x201C;Adult Supervision&#x201D; phase becomes unbearable and the product teams never maintain systems or automate anything. Platform teams are created to remove dependence on experts (e.g. a platform team integrates an ETL tool, removing a bottleneck on data engineering). In essence, these are teams which are building products for the people who build products. We can call these products &#x201C;capabilities&quot; as seen below (partial list):</li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a4779c3-9d0e-4f66-9d67-3dc6d7bc82d9_1278x1102.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to start a product engineering platform team" loading="lazy"></figure><ol><li><strong>Independent business units:</strong> Even with automation and platform teams, the org gets too large for a single leader to manage and it starts hiving off into different business lines, separate P&amp;L responsibility, etc.</li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fc1a00c-be29-481c-a897-56f879d5d51a_1306x830.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to start a product engineering platform team" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Although this progression deserves a longer post in itself, I&#x2019;m going to dig into phase 3 (platform teams).</p><h4 id="why-platform-teams">Why platform teams?</h4><p>Dhruv put the problem well, when he said:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Everyone is milking the cow, but no one is feeding it or giving it water&#x201D;</blockquote><p>What he means is that the product teams are responsible for business outcomes (e.g. payments, shopping cart, administration, lending, etc). &#xA0;But no one is responsible for any particular code base, least of all the generalized ones (such as an API gateway or a transaction database). &#xA0;In addition, no one is responsible at all for non-functional requirements like scalability, security, reliability, etc. &#xA0;The org wants to address this by forming a platform team.</p><p>He&#x2019;s seen platform teams fail because they are out of touch with the teams they serve, or they are starved of influence / budget or they fail to make meaningful changes on any reasonable time frame so is curious to discover what the best practices are to avoid this.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s dig into what platforms do and some best practices on how to run them.</p><h4 id="the-ideal-platform-team-is-a-product-team"><strong>The ideal platform team is a product team:</strong></h4><p>We defined earlier that platform teams are product teams which build products that help the actual product teams build things for customers. This is a gross generalization, but it&#x2019;s a useful metaphor since it correlates with many things we know about why product teams go south.</p><p><strong>Distribution is more important than product:</strong> Engineers have been complaining about poor debugging capabilities. The platform team comes in and integrates a log aggregation service and a request tracing and search tool. Amazing. Only problem is, the garbage log messages sprinkled across 20 microservices make it impossible to use. Now you need all those engineers who were clamoring for this capability to go through and audit all of their log messages. Where do you think this falls in the product backlog? Fucking nowhere, - that&#x2019;s right.</p><p>A good platform team considers this and only attempts products they have broad support for politically (boss says so) or are easy to build grassroots support for through incremental progress. &#xA0;Always consider distribution as the primary hindrance to success, not how useful or how easy it is to build something.</p><p><strong>Connect the dots:</strong> When planning a &#x201C;tech roadmap&#x201D; or &#x201C;engineering roadmap&#x201D; as distinct from a &#x201C;product roadmap&#x201D;, it&#x2019;s super important that you have some tangential connection to your company strategy. For instance, if your strategy is to be the &#x201C;bank with the best customer service&#x201D;, then investing in an automated ETL pipeline for customer data makes sense so your CRM team has up to date information. Sure, it also means the CRM team stops bugging your engineers, but you should be able to connect the dots for the CEO too and be defensible. Here&#x2019;s a<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11hRylXud--7-PNuxnq5VF-drsTmqW7U4Ba_Xb0s_nTU/edit?usp=sharing" rel> template</a> which might help.</p><p><strong>Priority is a singular noun:</strong> Many force multipliers in engineering don&#x2019;t have any benefit unless you have 100% adoption. For instance, let&#x2019;s say you want to use a more modern CI system which allows you to stage hotfixes and the old one doesn&#x2019;t support it. This requires every single micro-service to update its Ansible/Puppet/k8s/whatever build file. If even one service isn&#x2019;t done, then all this work adds no value. Teams will often give an arbitrary &#x201C;20% to engineering work&#x201D; as a concession. This is a terribly broken model, because 80% of the work is happening at low efficiency, and if the 20% isn&#x2019;t crossing the finish line on a project, it&#x2019;s just making the project take longer because of context switching and shifting baselines.</p><p>So when a project requires 100% compliance to be effective, get a mandate from above, stop <em>everything </em>(within reason) and just get the SOB done in a week. Trust me, nothing is that hard when everyone is mobbing it.</p><p><strong>Build in the public, be a plumber coach:</strong> That being said&#x2026; most projects do add value without getting 100% done. So most of the time, your job as a platform team is to be a janitor, not an architect. Staying in touch with deployments, on-calls, onboarding, migrations, etc and unblocking people is the primary work. When you&#x2019;ve served them, only then will they listen to you as you try to push for new standards.</p><p>Keep weekly or bi-weekly demos / emails going out, run lunch and learns, facilitate post-mortems, and ensure engineering problems get the right visibility. This requires that you also understand the product roadmap and are willing to get your hands dirty with operational concerns too.</p><p><strong>Rotate. &#xA0;</strong>It&#x2019;s crucially important that you don&#x2019;t let people stay in product or platform teams forever. &#xA0;Folks should be shifted around either on a rotational basis or longer-term. &#xA0;That <strong>does not</strong> mean having one person half in either team, but perhaps doing a quarter in the platform team once a year or moving after a year in product makes sense. &#xA0;The reverse is also true. &#xA0;Failure to do this will ensure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" rel>Conway&#x2019;s law</a> trips up your best laid plans.</p><h3 id="the-takeaway-1m"><strong>The takeaway (1m):</strong></h3><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wNDVVq_DLFY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409" style="--tw-translate-x:0; --tw-translate-y:0; --tw-rotate:0; --tw-skew-x:0; --tw-skew-y:0; --tw-scale-x:1; --tw-scale-y:1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness:proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width:0px; --tw-ring-offset-color:#fff; --tw-ring-color:rgb(59 130 246 / 0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow:0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow:0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow:0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow-colored:0 0 #0000; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; position: absolute; display: block; top: 0px; left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; height: 409.5px; width: 728px; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);"></iframe></figure><h2 id="wrapping-up-and-other-ideas">Wrapping up and other ideas:</h2><p>I hope this post has helped you think about how to structure your engineering platform teams.

<li>Hurting back</li>
<li>accusing the offender of either intentionally doing it or</li>
<li>An attack on the offender&apos;s character.</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Then the offender is shocked with the accusation and defends themselves, focusing on the offended person&apos;s response instead of the original thing. &#xA0;They do this since to them the original offense wasn&apos;t intentional and isn&apos;t seen as even a big deal. This goes on forever if you let it.</p><p>Each thing said in response is like a new car pulling into an intersection. Eventually it&apos;s gridlock. &#xA0;But each new argument adds a new car trying to pull though. &#xA0;Now, the only way out is to reverse each car one by one by hearing the hurt feeling and acknowledging it (at least). &#xA0;Someone has to go first. Unfortunately, the only available traffic cops are also the drunk drivers.</p><p>When I go first, say sorry, and back up my car, I expect you to do the same. &#xA0;If you don&apos;t, and instead pull forward, I get pissed and drive mine back in the fray. &#xA0;It&apos;s not about who is right, but there was offense taken, and that offense needs to be understood and acknowledged. &#xA0;</p><p>You don&apos;t necessarily have to say you were wrong, but if I feel like you don&apos;t even know what I&apos;m upset about, I feel like you don&apos;t even care, and if I feel like you don&apos;t even care, I&apos;m not going to make two moves in a row.</p><p>This is how we can manage to stay in unproductive conflict with people we care about over things we don&apos;t.</p>]]></content:encoded>

But when something invariably does go wrong (merging on the highway or an accident), there is no space. &#xA0;Everyone else is already fully utilized on other stuff. We try to adjust, but we just jam up the whole thing.</p><h2 id="the-case-for-slack">The case for slack</h2><p>Now, many would say &quot;that&apos;s okay, it will happen less efficiently, but it will happen eventually.&quot; &#xA0;This might be okay for you. &#xA0;But the core tenant of agile is rapid loops of small batch releases and learning. When the organization is running multiple projects in parallel instead of a few key projects serially, we will absolutely hit gridlock.</p><p>Add to that cross-incentives between different stakeholders, and it becomes unclear which project is the Google Search Index and which one is the Google Doodle. &#xA0;Even if it is clear, the Google Doodle manager is measured on &quot;awwws per minute&quot; and will obviously resist giving away their key engineer.</p><p>Makes sense that we need slack in the system to allow for priorities to shift and mistakes to happen, right? &#xA0;How do we make it happen?</p><h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2><p>You can&apos;t have slack all over the org. So <u>first step</u> is to resource fully dedicated x-functional teams to products and keep those boundaries fairly rigid. &#xA0;There&apos;s a huge cost to &quot;borrowing&quot; engineers between products.</p><p>The <u>second step</u> is to correctly visualize and measure the value stream (where delays happen) so that it&apos;s obvious where the constraints are. &#xA0;This could be as simple as a standup, or as complex as a Kanban board.</p><p>The <u>third step</u> is to limit specialization. In the Google Search Index team, let&apos;s say we have a database indexing engineer. &#xA0;They may be 25% utilized most of the time, but during a big update, there might be demand for 400% of their time. &#xA0;This slows the entire project while the rest of the team waits on them. &#xA0;They move from being the slack to being the constraint. &#xA0;A forward thinking manager would ensure that another engineering with similar skills (a background in caching or encryption) would x-train so they are able to do some of the indexing engineer&apos;s work.</p><h2 id="but-we-cant-just-pay-people-to-sit-around">But we can&apos;t just pay people to sit around!</h2><p>Even if we do the above 3 steps, there is still a problem. &#xA0;As a project starts, It&apos;s mostly product and design. &#xA0;So engineers are at very low utilization. &#xA0;They participate in the product and design work a bit, but are usually not even on the team at this point (another problem). QA is zero util.</p><p>Next phase we are mostly building out an MVP with a limited backend to test the market. &#xA0;So all 3 front-ends are engaged, but backend work is light. &#xA0;QA is planning a bit, but mostly empty. Then we engage QA at the end of an iteration, but they take 4 days to test the build while others are mostly sitting empty.</p><p>If product and other engineers do QA a bit and a front-end engineer learns some python, we can sort of balance this out (see above). &#xA0;But it doesn&apos;t mean everyone is at 100% util.</p><p><strong>So what happens on most teams? &#xA0;</strong></p><p>They start the next project on the roadmap simultaneously (this is the fatal mistake). &#xA0;</p><p>If frontend is 100% utilized in sprint 1, and backend is 50% utilized, they will start the backend parts slated for sprint 2. &#xA0;Sounds good in theory, but in reality, sprint 1 projects will spill over, demand will come from other teams for help, a new person needs onboarding, on on-call shift will turn into an all-nighter, etc. etc. In sprint 2, backend will again be under utilized as front-end catches up.</p><h2 id="the-slacklog">The slacklog</h2><p>In my experience as a product engineering leader and a coach, I think the #1 reason teams fall into this trap is not that they believe doing more things at once is faster or better, it&apos;s because they are afraid of people sitting idle.</p><p>So here&apos;s a proposal: &#xA0;Let&apos;s make a Slacklog for every team / function.</p><h3 id="whats-a-slacklog">What&apos;s a Slacklog?</h3><p>A Slacklog is a backlog of things which <em>can</em> happen, but don&apos;t <em>need</em> to happen.</p><p>Slacklog criteria:</p><ol><li>Not in direct support of any quarterly business targets</li><li>Broken down to no more than 2 day projects</li><li>Immediately executable by &gt;1 person on the team (no pet projects)</li><li>Easily understandable and clearly valuable</li><li>Uncontroversial (no politics or approvals)</li></ol><h3 id="building-a-slacklog">Building a slacklog:</h3><ol><li>Get the team together</li><li>Use this set of prompts (or make up your own)</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>We could avoid ________ on our team if only we had a tool that would _________.</li>
<li>If we knew ______ about  , it would help us prioritize.</li>
<li>We think ___________ technology could make us do ___________ in a more __________ way.</li>
<li>New joiners on our team find it hard to get started because of ____________.</li>
<li>It would be much easier for people to interact with us if gave them the ability to ____________.</li>
<li>We could make better prioritization decisions if we could visualize ______________.</li>
<li>We would have less downtime if we fixed _______________.</li>
<li>It would be easier to recover from bugs if we knew _________________.</li>
<li>It would be a lot more fun to work here if we had ___________________.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol start="3">
<li>Have everyone fill up minimum 1, max 3 ideas independently.</li>
<li>Group / De-duplicate.</li>
<li>Use dot voting to make a prioritized list.</li>
<li>Choose the top &quot;team size / 2&quot; problems.  Have a pair of teammates work on detailing each  (ideally put product people on some engineering problems and visa-versa). Note: this is not a commitment to do the work, see slacklog criteria #3 above.</li>
<li>If you need to play HiPPO, play a little HiPPO, but otherwise let the team own it.</li>
<li>Each pair diverges and creates 1-3 options on how to address the issue with a rough size.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>e.g. New joiners on our team find it hard to get started because of unclear and inconsistent API parameters. We could...</li>
<li>Check all the inline API docs for correctness and explain inconsistencies (M)</li>
<li>Build a facade around inconsistent services with Open API compliant methods (L)</li>
<li>Make a simple training checklist and ensure newbies are run through it (S)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you&apos;ve got a slacklog!</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="how-to-use-a-slacklog">How to use a slacklog:</h3><p><strong>Purge:</strong> Ensure the slacklog doesn&apos;t get too long. &#xA0;Consider wiping it out and building fresh every 6 months. &#xA0;If something hasn&apos;t gotten done in 6 months, it&apos;s probably not very important.</p><p><strong>Celebrate:</strong> Even though these are optional tasks, it doesn&apos;t mean they shouldn&apos;t be celebrated and demoed. &#xA0;It&apos;s also important to make sure people doing the primary stream aren&apos;t the only ones being rewarded.</p><p><strong>Handoff:</strong> Don&apos;t let people own tasks. &#xA0;This is another form of constraint. &#xA0;Tasks should be simple enough to transfer easily and should be jointly owned by as many people as possible.</p><p><strong>Increase flow:</strong> Use this as an opportunity to have backend engineers do QA focused Slacklog items or designers do front-end engineering items. &#xA0;They will be slower to execute, but in the future, they will be able to take on other job roles, thereby eliminating the need for slack.</p><h2 id="now-go-slack-off">Now go slack off!</h2><p>I&apos;ve never done this explicitly, but have tried similar things. &#xA0;Would love to hear if it worked for your organization/team.</p>]]></content:encoded>

One person? Everyone? Someone who can harm your career?</p><p>But anonymous feedback also robs the giver of something important: perspective. &#xA0;By creating a transaction as opposed to entering into a conversation, they are only expressing their side. &#xA0;The are not understanding why the receiver behaved that way.</p><p>There may be good reasons for their behavior which the giver should consider, or there may be bad reasons that other people will have in the future and it is worth understanding them.</p><p>The giver in an anonymous format is also now susceptible to confirmation bias because they have not contextualized the receiver&apos;s experience. &#xA0;Any hint of repeat behavior will immediately trigger the confirmation and increase the cycle of conflict.</p><p>In any request to change another, we are inadvertently changing ourselves. &#xA0;Doing this without a conversation leaves us more susceptible to bias and conflict.</p><p>Given all of this, in organizations I run in the future, I will not encourage anonymous feedback and certainly will avoid at all costs being the relayer of such feedback.</p><p>Authenticity, candor and equanimity is a harder path, but for a sustaining culture, it&apos;s a path worth taking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A <em>direction</em> is a problem to solve, a <em>goal</em> is a target to show that problem has been solved and probably some sense of the tactics to achieve it. It is a subtle difference, but an important one.</p><p>So, unless your entire org will get realigned to chase top level goals, it&#x2019;s important that at the very least, we want ensure that each team is clear on which core problem they are trying to solve and if possible, have them solving only one. &#xA0;And by team I don&#x2019;t mean function (like Engineering), try to get it down to the &#x201C;2 pizza&#x201D; size if possible. &#xA0;That for me is the goal of strategic planning. </p><h3 id="the-three-phases-of-strategic-planning">The three phases of strategic planning</h3><ol><li>Identify an overall strategy given the environment and our position in it. Map that to a customer or org problem we are solving.</li><li>Make a mind map of the value provided to the customer, down to all unknown or un-executed pieces of that value</li><li>Apply that map to an org structure</li></ol><p>When we are absolutely sure from the top that we are doing X, don&#x2019;t make it a conversation. &#xA0;Be clear on it, explain why, convince, etc&#x2026; but it is what it is. &#xA0;<br><br>Then form 2nd level x-functional groups for each major goal. &#xA0;Their job is not to plan the entire 6 months of tactics. &#xA0;Their goal at this point should be to define inputs: x1, x2, x3 <strong>whether it applies to their function of not. &#xA0;</strong>&#x201C;x&#x201D; in this case is still in the realm of problems to solve, not tactics. &#xA0;It doesn&#x2019;t concern itself with the org and what is possible, it concerns itself with the <strong>customer</strong> we are trying to serve. &#xA0;<br><br>In an effort to be inclusive, we tend to want to involve everyone early. &#xA0;In the effort to efficient, we tend to involve everyone late. &#xA0;Who is required to complete that map? &#xA0;Not everyone who will execute on it actually, but people who are required to imagine the unknown / un-executed pieces. &#xA0;<br><br>Post that, involve all teams to suggest goals for themselves which align to x1, x2, x3 and then try to consolidate the two and meet in the middle. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s a tricky dance for sure&#x2026; but this is my orientation.</p><p><strong>tldr; The first goal is to define smaller problem statements. &#xA0;The next goal is to map that against the org. They are two separate problems.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

Asking since, &#xA0;lately i have worked on some interesting things but somehow i forget details. wondering if writing could help with this.</blockquote><p>Writing is where I go when I have no choice. &#xA0;When I keep repeating thoughts, when there is no way to untangle a mess.</p><p>People think good writing is about the words you use or the imagery you invoke. That&apos;s not really true. &#xA0;That&apos;s pretty writing. &#xA0;Pretty writing is pretty, but it&apos;s not always good.</p><p>Good writing is nothing more than clear thinking. &#xA0;But clear thinking is really, really hard. &#xA0;Writing, especially when edited (as opposed to just thinking or talking) let&apos;s you craft with confidence a connection between different ideas.</p><p>It forces you to explicitly define that connection, and why it is relevant so that another may understand it. &#xA0; But the benefit is mostly your own.</p><p>So should you publish? &#xA0;I publish about 1% of the shit I write. &#xA0;Most pieces are hardly read, but I&apos;ve found that I can&apos;t manufacture the pressure of public exposure, so I publish anyway to force myself to a higher standard. &#xA0;In that, it&apos;s worth doing.</p><p>But also, some of my blog posts have gone viral and that&apos;s been good for my career, getting speaking engagements, etc. etc.</p><p>So yes, start writing. &#xA0;I recommend the first thing to do is to make a time for journaling every week. &#xA0;Shut off the internet, keep an hour to just document what went well last week, what you fucked up, why, how you will fix it and most importantly, what your intentions are for the week, and for life.</p><p>Sounds daunting, but it&apos;s just an hour. Even 20min is a good start. &#xA0;This is one of the best practices I&apos;ve picked up (even if I bail sometimes).</p><p>So good luck and just start.</p>]]></content:encoded>

When there is not a clear consensus on what to do, I try to look for the minimal possible change.</p><p><strong>Minimal possible change, minimal time-frame to evaluate.</strong><br>This means less disagreement around trying, and less impact to the team.</p><p><strong>Choose a group responsible for the decision and the team empowers them to take the call.</strong><br>This avoids the endless discussion which gets reset every time someone disagrees</p><p><strong>Be specific about success criteria</strong><br>Before starting the experiment, agree on what the concerns are, and how we will check in X weeks or Y months to ensure those concerns aren&apos;t a problem. This avoids confirmation bias when we typically continue to justify our initial opinions about what will happen.</p><p>For example: &#xA0;Instead of &quot;Hey team! I decided we will not have any more meetings between 10AM and 6PM on Mon-Wed&quot;, you could say:</p><p>&quot;Let&apos;s try not scheduling any meetings on Wednesdays for one month. &#xA0;It might be the case that this just pushes meetings outside work hours, so we will ask people not to schedule outside work hours, and will check in with people in 1:1s to find out if that&apos;s happening. &#xA0;The decision will be revisited in one month by Amrita, Joe and Mariela.&quot;</p><p>If we do this, we can often spend less time in disagreement and more time learning about what works for us. &#xA0;So next time you&apos;re thinking of what *really* needs to change that you can&apos;t seem to get everyone to agree on, try doing less, faster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/2020/08/tumblr_n2l3cl7NxU1r2ekhjo1_500.png" alt="The sunk emotional costs fallacy"><p>I recently went through a painful &quot;breakup&quot; which was really more of a failure to launch with someone who I met only once, but had 3 months of intense long-distance communication with beforehand. It was rare for me to get so hung up about a relationship - but it messed me up pretty good. More than relationships which were actually much more meaningful and had much more love and affection and joined lives. &#xA0;I can&apos;t say I ever loved this person, but the end of our thing hurt more than many people I loved deeply... Why is this?</p><p>I&apos;ve determined the reason for this is really less about the person (who is quite beautiful and intelligent and all of that), and more about the dynamic of dating people who play hot and cold to hold your attention, while not really caring for you or your feelings very deeply. </p><p>Trying to date someone who isn&apos;t clear about their intentions is like playing poker. In the beginning, they don&apos;t show you much interest. &#xA0;It&apos;s fine, you don&apos;t know them, there are lots of fish in the sea. You send a few more texts, this is just throwing in 5 chips for the deal...</p><p>Then they start reciprocating and it&apos;s exciting. &#xA0;Then they pull away again and you think &quot;okay, maybe they don&apos;t like me as much&quot; or &quot;they are unsure of my feelings&quot;, then they come back and intensify and it feels like something real. You begin to talk intimately (or get intimate physically). You drop a 20 in the pot. </p><p>They pull away again and this time it hurts, so you reach out and communicate that you&apos;re not sure of their intentions. &#xA0;They reassure you, and it feels good. But you start to question yourself. &#xA0;Why am I always seeing them pulling away, but they say they are interested? &#xA0;And the cycle keeps accelerating. &#xA0;</p><blockquote>Every time you give a little bit of your own needs up, you feel a little bit less because you believe <strong>what they are saying</strong> over <strong>how you are feeling.</strong></blockquote><p>Each one of these cycles is like raising the stakes in a poker game. &#xA0;And after awhile, you&apos;re looking at the pot. The pot is huge. &#xA0;You&apos;ve invested so much emotionally - not because you&apos;ve connected deeply, because you probably have not - but because you have overcome your pain and doubt and stayed in the game. You have delayed the grieving of each micro-rejection, each following gaslighting. Each time you do this, you double the pot, making it bigger and bigger, making it scarier and scarier to lose.</p><p>After awhile, you realize that you have a pair of twos, and even if you &quot;win&quot;, which is highly unlikely, this person is really not someone who cares about you. &#xA0;So there is no benefit in playing the hand. &#xA0;You should fold. &#xA0;Your friends know you should fold. &#xA0;You know you should fold. &#xA0;BUT THE POT IS SO BIG. &#xA0;You keep playing because it seems insane to just give up after subjugating yourself by denying your instincts for so long.</p><p>The farther we stretch ourselves to override our instincts, the greater the confirmation bias that is developed - the more important it is to be right about the previous questionable decisions.</p><p>What is the lesson here? &#xA0;The obvious one is to fold early. &#xA0;But that&apos;s terrible advice. &#xA0;It is lonely out there, and dating is terrible, and when you see someone who you really admire, it&apos;s very hard to let that go. &#xA0;Even the slightest of reassurance will have you quickly taking your heart out of your chest and dropping in on top of the chips. &#xA0;It happens to us all. &#xA0;It just happened to me. &#xA0;I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll be wiser next time.</p><p>But I think next time, I will try to remember this: Play to win and bet big, but up the ante on them. &#xA0;Give them an ultimatum around how you want to be treated and the type of relationship you want, and fucking stick to it. &#xA0;Even though that will mean closing up early in many cases. &#xA0;Every time you give up some of yourself to keep them around, you are making it less likely that you will ever find common ground even if it is possible. &#xA0;So stand tall - you are worth it. &#xA0;There is no percentage in finding companionship with someone who will always make your wonder if that companionship is real.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Note: Image stolen from http://www.elmohood.com. &#xA0;If you don&apos;t like it, tell me and I&apos;ll take it down. It&apos;s a cool image and I don&apos;t make money from this</p>]]></content:encoded>

It was a gratifying experience - I wanted to briefly share one of the stories here.</p><p>P is a business analyst / program manager with 12 years of hardcore domain experience in a specialized sector, with a long time at a single MNC. &#xA0;He wants to move into a primarily leadership role and for the right reasons: He is fulfilled by fostering the development of his team and he wants more say in strategic decisions.</p><p>But he&apos;s not getting that. So we looked at two avenues he has laid out. Both topics deserve posts in themselves,</p><ol><li>How do you change domains when your network is very limited and your expertise is very specific? Who will give you a chance and why?</li><li>What&apos;s stopping you from getting trust of management to grow your span of control in your current organization?</li></ol><p>In his case, for <strong>#1</strong>, we talked about several behaviors that can be effective:</p><ul><li><strong>Be more specific</strong> in your interest and shout it out to anyone who wants to hear it. Asking people for connections does nothing, asking people for a connection to a specific individual or a specific company, or an informational interview can open doors and build relationships</li><li><strong>Network with public figures too. </strong>Follow people in the domain you are interested in, or from your skillset on twitter, linkedin, etc and interact with them on their content. &#xA0;You&apos;d be surprised how accessible so called &quot;celebrities&quot; are if you&apos;re authentically engaged and not self-serving in your interactions. &#xA0;These people, but more importantly, their communities can open doors and open your mind.</li><li><strong>Get used to rejection. &#xA0;</strong>People use biases to take quicker decisions. Those biases are largely ineffective but they are there. &#xA0;There is the college name bias (if I had an IIM degree people would listen to me) and there is the domain bias (this person will take too long to ramp). &#xA0;Yes, they are more often wrong than right, but you can&apos;t fight every battle. &#xA0;Just keep reaching out.</li></ul><p>On the 2nd one, we spoke about his challenges to grow within the organization from a leadership (as opposed to a technical) angle. &#xA0;When we started the conversation he said to me &quot;It&apos;s really a privilege to talk to a CTO of a big company, I would never get this chance in my organization.&quot; &#xA0;To which I replied: &quot;Have you tried?&quot;.</p><p>Most of the time, we sell ourselves short. &#xA0;And the best leaders are the ones which don&apos;t seek power for power&apos;s sake and they often are left by the wayside as a result. &#xA0;Sadly, this can concentrate big egos and borderline sociopaths in senior management, but it doesn&apos;t have to be that way.</p><p>I asked him if he has explicitly laid down his intentions to his manager and asked for a plan. &#xA0;He had not as &quot;my manager is fairly new, and things change a lot here, so it doesn&apos;t seem like the right time.&quot;</p><p><strong>It will never be the right time for an organization to take care of you.</strong></p><p>Organizations are intrinsically designed to serve themselves. &#xA0;Accept this, and be specific about what it needs to do for you. &#xA0;AND you need to be comfortable knowing that if you don&apos;t get what you want in the time frame you want it, you are ready to move on. &#xA0;He is still nervous about this, but agreed to have a specific discussion with his manager about a 6 month plan to change his profile to a multi-team leadership role.</p><p>I recommended this course of action rather than moving out, because ultimately, management promotions are mostly based on trust, not on competence in management. &#xA0;Especially the leap from junior to senior or mid-level management. &#xA0;As a senior leader, I need you to be assertive if I&apos;m going to give you a larger leadership role *and* I need to trust your ethics, orientation and integrity are in line with my expectations. &#xA0;Using the trust network in his organization - the people who can vouch for him - and being assertive about his needs would be the best way to get that opportunity to show the world what a fantastic leader he can be (and I think he will be).</p><p>I hope this was helpful for anyone reading. &#xA0;I&apos;m taking on clients for <a href="http://jacobsingh.name/technology-leadership-coaching" rel="noopener nofollow">executive coaching, organizational development and technical advisory services</a>.</p><p>Thanks for reading!

I&apos;ve found that this happens, but maybe these will help you shortcut the process. I&apos;ll keep updating it as I think of stuff.</p><p><strong>Starter, levain, etc.</strong></p><p>Do not waste flour feeding a ton of starter, just dump most of it out. &#xA0;By most of it, I mean everything except a spoon (20-30g) is fine.</p><p>It&apos;s not really a big advantage (if any) to keep feeding your starter. &#xA0;Keep it in the fridge, take a couple spoons out and just feed it in the morning you plan to mix (but better results if you feed it the night before also).</p><p>Levain is just a fancy word for starter - usually used to denote starter which is ready for baking (instead of the stuff in your fridge)</p><p>A &quot;Stuff levain&quot; won&apos;t pass the float test usually! Don&apos;t sweat it, look for bubbles on the side.</p><p>Float test is great, but the best indicator of an active starter are the bubbles on the side.</p><p>Want a more sour dough? &#xA0;Add more whole wheat to your starter</p><p><strong>Proportions and recipes</strong></p><p>Start with low hydration. &#xA0;You can work up quickly, but a loaf @ 60 or 65% is very easy to work with and will help you get a sense for different techniques and timings - this is why you do it.</p><p>Autolyse is super important if you aren&apos;t using fancy flour. &#xA0;Mix gently, then like 1hr in the fridge of just flour + water, then 30min outside, then add starter and salt.</p><p><strong>Mixing and strengthening dough</strong></p><p>Stretch and Fold is usually not enough. &#xA0;Mix your starter in nicely by making a little C-shape with your fingers together and use it like a backhoe to pick up the dough from underneath and stretch it out a bit. &#xA0;Do this for 5-7 minutes at least once, maybe twice in the first 1/2hr after mixing the starter in. &#xA0;dough will become really strong (you can stretch it nicely).</p><p>You don&apos;t need to maintain the &quot;skin&quot; when you stretch and fold, just go for it.</p><p>When shaping, first &quot;degas&quot; the dough - this means stretch it flat and pressing down till the air bubbles come out. &#xA0;If you don&apos;t you get big ass pockets of air later.</p><p><strong>Shaping and Degassing:</strong> Degas first and then preshape very gently with as little flour as possible (this means just fold it over itself a couple times then kinda push it into a loose ball shape - no tension, wait 10-15min, then degass again and shape fully.</p><p>When shaping, don&apos;t stress getting it perfect. &#xA0;Working it too much will screw it up and add too much flour. &#xA0;If you&apos;ve done the strengthening part well (mixing and stretch and fold), it will come together nicely. &#xA0;If you haven&apos;t, shaping won&apos;t do much anyway.</p><p>The bannaton (I use a plastic bowl and a towel) is <em>supposed</em> to hold up the dough in shape. &#xA0;So it shouldn&apos;t be too big or it will just go flat.</p><p>When you take a loaf out of the fridge, it won&apos;t pass the poke test! Even after 30-45min, it still might not and be fine.</p><p>When doing the poke test on wet dough, cover your finger with flour first.</p><p><strong>Baking in shitty ovens or with bad equipment</strong></p><p>Just make sure everything is as hot as you can get it - the oven and your baking vessel. &#xA0;That&apos;s the most important thing. &#xA0;*note: if all you have is a flimsy cookie sheet, maybe don&apos;t get that super-duper hot. Just 5-10min preheat is good.</p><p><em>If you&apos;re burning the bottom of your sourdough:</em></p><p>Use semolina (suji) on the pan/pot, and on top of the parchment paper to prevent burning.</p><p>Put tinfoil shiny side down on the rack if you&apos;re burning the bottom</p><p>Switch to broil after 20min for 10min if you&apos;re burning the bottom often</p><p>Take the loaf out after it has risen in the oven and put it on the rack directly if you&apos;re burning the bottom.</p><p><strong>Cooling and serving</strong></p><p>Let. it. cool. &#xA0;It keeps cooking. &#xA0;Give it 1hr minimum, ideally 2 or 3. &#xA0;It sours and gets better with age. &#xA0;If you don&apos;t cut it, it won&apos;t dry up.</p><p>Cut using a serraded knife, gently saw away, don&apos;t press down at all - will eventually happen.</p><p>Cut from the middle first. &#xA0;This let&apos;s you take fancy show-off crumb pictures, but it also means you can cut even pieces from each side easier and if you sandwich the two sides together, you can keep it from drying out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Grofers has been no exception.</p><p>Unlike many business and economic scenarios that can be estimated or predicted for, COVID-19 stands as a tough exception. What this means for us is that our larger focus for March has been on only <em>two</em> things:</p><ul><li>Indian households receive their essential supplies of grocery and household items without hiccups.</li><li>And they get it in a way that&#x2019;s safe and hygienic.</li></ul><p>To achieve this, we have made some important decisions, some of which can be read through in our <a href="http://www.grofers.com/india-fights-coronavirus">official covid-19 microsite</a> and in this <a href="https://grofers.com/blog/over-1-million-households-served-100-million-more-to-go/">recent blog post</a>. However, if you haven&#x2019;t been able to follow through the updates, we understand.</p><p>So in this blog, we&#x2019;d like to share what we have been shipping, the decisions we have made, and what you can expect in the coming days and weeks.</p><h2 id="1-we-introduced-contactless-deliveries">1. We introduced contactless deliveries</h2><p>We care a lot about the safety and hygiene of the products that we deliver to our customers. With covid-19 and its exponential spread around the globe, this has become even more important for us.</p><p>We are solving two problems:</p><ul><li>Spreading awareness (and importance) of contactless deliveries.</li><li>Making it easier to opt-in so maximum users avail it.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/What-we-have-been-shipping-at-Grofers/0-e7z8e5HQ0ZGfYxkR.gif" class="kg-image" alt="What we have been shipping at Grofers" loading="lazy"><figcaption>.</figcaption></figure><p>On March 17th, we launched <strong>zero-touch delivery:</strong> an intuitive, easy-to-opt-in, and safe way for you to get your groceries and household essentials.</p><p>All our customers can opt for zero-touch delivery through the Grofers app or by making a phone call to their delivery partner.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>we also trained our delivery partners in parallel about the importance and significance of zero-touch delivery along with the best practices to make it possible.</blockquote><p>The program now serves 6000+ households in Gurgaon, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Kolkata, as we continue to improve and bring zero-touch to as many people as possible. If you have more ideas for improvement, please email us at <a href="mailto:zerotouch@grofers.com">zerotouch@grofers.com</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Recommended reading</strong></em><em>: </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/30/21199714/grocery-store-delivery-coronavirus-safe-empty"><em>Your coronavirus grocery questions, answered by experts</em></a><em> by Vox.</em></p><h2 id="2-fixed-slot-opening-times">2. Fixed slot opening&#xA0;times</h2><p>Every day, our app is seeing over 1.5 million people trying to order. Given the constraints on how many people we can cater to, we are only able to serve 1 out of 8 customers today.</p><p>The outcome? Server crashes. Below is an image of the increase in checkouts the moment we started taking orders. While it is every company&#x2019;s dream to see these surges, the reality is not fun. Engineers love scale but hate sudden scale.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/What-we-have-been-shipping-at-Grofers/0-pxQj8q_3H3cm-vFL.png" class="kg-image" alt="What we have been shipping at Grofers" loading="lazy"></figure><p>In the beginning we resorted to randomizing slot opening times to balance the queue prioritization and also manage the load on servers.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve now addressed these scalability concerns and most areas have available slots. In the case all slots are full, a time is shown to the user when slots will open up again so they can plan their purchase.</p><h2 id="3-we-have-introduced-group-orders-for-societies">3. We have introduced group orders for societies</h2><p>Along with the benefits of zero-touch delivery, we are partnering with RWAs and societies to supply essential grocery items with safer, low-cost, and faster access.</p><p>Societies can now go to the Grofers app and order as a group, which helps us serve more households with faster delivery time.</p><p>To achieve this, we have created a simple sign-up flow. After confirmation, societies, and RWAs will have a custom catalog stocked with essentials and the customers will be able to see the slots.</p><blockquote><em>This will allow society and RWAs to reserve delivery slots for their orders, can order for as low as INR 200 (compared to INR 800 for individual orders) and can avail free delivery on all orders above INR 800 (compared to INR 1200 for individual orders).</em></blockquote><p>On our end,<strong> </strong>orders are pre-identified since customers use RWA/Society&#x2019;s interface on the app automatically (based on your location). Moreover, all of these orders will be dropped at the defined location in the RWA with zero-touch practice in place.</p><p>The delivery <strong>confirmation is provided with a </strong>photo-proof and signature from a security guard, individually for each order delivered.</p><h2 id="4-launching-dark-stores">4. Launching dark&#xA0;stores</h2><p>To increase the supply of groceries and reach out to more people efficiently, we need more space and manpower at the local level. To achieve this, we have now launched Dark Stores.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/What-we-have-been-shipping-at-Grofers/0-bT_ruO1THh1MSemH.png" class="kg-image" alt="What we have been shipping at Grofers" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Dark stores are mini warehouses around our users that help them get better (and faster) access to grocery essentials. On our side, we are providing technology and inventory at scale.</p><p>The first three stores are already up in Gurugram and Ghaziabad with more on the way.</p><blockquote>If you&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;or someone you know&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;has space and are willing to run a dark store- please get in touch at express@grofers.com.</blockquote><h2 id="5-we-now-let-users-edit-their-carts-multiple-times">5. We now let users edit their carts, multiple&#xA0;times</h2><p>In our communications recently, we have been urging all our customers to follow three simple rules: a) don&#x2019;t hoard b) don&#x2019;t panic c) plan ahead.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/What-we-have-been-shipping-at-Grofers/0-ukN7F5e7XNR49CJx.gif" class="kg-image" alt="What we have been shipping at Grofers" loading="lazy"></figure><p>The underlying anxiety behind this is a <em>lack of control.</em></p><ul><li>What would happen if I ran out of my essential supplies?</li><li>What if there&#x2019;s no stock (or less stock)?</li></ul><p>To address these anxieties, our team has now introduced the option to edit your cart and add items multiple times.</p><p>Forgot to add atta to your order? You can add it and combine it with your last order. Just remembered that you needed to include a beverage for your daughter? No problem, you can make that change too.</p><blockquote>Multiple edits to your cart can be made until 8 hours before your scheduled delivery. Whatever you add to your order, gets delivered to you as a whole.</blockquote><p>We will continue to improve this feature and are slowly rolling it out to all our users.</p><h2 id="6-we-are-limiting-the-quantity-of-an-item-in-an-order">6. We are limiting the quantity of an item in an&#xA0;order</h2><p>To help avoid hoarding and encourage our users to plan ahead, we have also started limiting the number of items a user can purchase in an order.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/What-we-have-been-shipping-at-Grofers/0-hW_ELL01zgdJE5f7.gif" class="kg-image" alt="What we have been shipping at Grofers" loading="lazy"></figure><p>The choice for customers might be limited for some time at Grofers. There is still plenty of supply to go around, but we have made ourselves leaner to be able to serve more customers. Moreover, this allows us to serve everyone equally&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;irrespective of any economic factors prohibiting an order.</p><p>We hope our users think of themselves&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and their families&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;as part of a big community. This is now more important than ever.</p><h2 id="7-users-can-now-get-notified-when-our-service-resumes">7. Users can now get notified when our service&#xA0;resumes</h2><p>In the last few weeks, we have faced certain operational challenges due to a nationwide lockdown.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/What-we-have-been-shipping-at-Grofers/0-f4OZCQ7a2op3t9et.gif" class="kg-image" alt="What we have been shipping at Grofers" loading="lazy"></figure><p>In certain areas, our warehouses were shut owing to some miscommunication, and while a good number of them are back up and running now, we are still working with authorities to resume some of our offices.</p><p>In between these challenges, we continued to have a huge influx of orders. This led to a high promise time, cancellations, and a few more hiccups.</p><p>To navigate it and put our users&#x2019; needs at the top, we have introduced notifications for our operational status.</p><p>What this means is that a customer can fill their cart and ask to be notified&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;if the operations in their city or area are paused. As soon as we resume our services, they get a notification, can then place their order, and we&#x2019;ll get it delivered in under 72 hours.</p><blockquote><em>This helps us tackle two problems: getting the essentials faster to the ones who need it the most. And second, it helps set expectations with our users on what they can expect&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;thereby creating transparency around our operations.</em></blockquote><h2 id="8-we-have-introduced-stock-levels-for-essential-items">8. We have introduced stock levels for essential items</h2><p>There&#x2019;s an underlying theme in all the decisions we are making right now: how can we introduce transparency in the decisions we are making and address our customer&#x2019;s anxieties?</p><blockquote><em>To put it simply, our teams are collectively solving for the following problem statement: &#x201C;In what ways can we create transparency in the grocery buying process?&#x201D;</em></blockquote><p>One such exercise led us to solve for anxiety about stock availability around grocery essentials.</p><p>Now, all our users right now can filter essential products based on their stock availability. They&#x2019;ll also see the products tagged as &#x201C;high stock availability&#x201D; or &#x201C;low stock availability&#x201D; depending on their stock levels.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/What-we-have-been-shipping-at-Grofers/0-l5FCHNHr5_QmYDkO.png" class="kg-image" alt="What we have been shipping at Grofers" loading="lazy"></figure><p>We hope this gives our customers better control over their plans for buying grocery essentials during covid-19.</p><h2 id="9-thank-a-delivery-hero">9. Thank a delivery&#xA0;hero</h2><p>In these tough times, our delivery partners are the heroes who have stepped up and taken charge. They are following all the precautions and are ensuring deliveries across India happen in the safest and most hygienic way&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;no loose ends.</p><p>While they man the front, they have also motivated us to keep pushing and innovating so we can better serve the millions of households that depend on grocery delivery right now. We are truly proud and thankful.</p><p>So now all our users can thank them too by simply visiting our app and leaving a thank you note. We regularly pass these messages to our delivery partners for whom, this serves as a consistent source of motivation and a higher call for service.</p><h2 id="10-ensuring-high-sanitary-standards-in-warehousing">10. Ensuring high sanitary standards in warehousing</h2><p>In compliance with recommendations from W.H.O, all of our partners and employees are screened for temperature and use facial masks (that are replaced every 2 days).</p><p>They are also sanitizing hands at regular intervals with soap and using sanitizer often. Watch the video to see how:</p><h2 id="11-ensuring-stable-livelihood">11. Ensuring stable livelihood</h2><p>For us, a stable livelihood of the community we impact is important. In line with that, here are some important steps we have taken:</p><ul><li>We have announced incentive programs for people who could not continue working with us due to operational issues.</li><li>We continue to work with local authorities to get permission for work without any hindrance.</li><li>Partnered with NGOs to deliver food &amp; groceries directly to their facilities. We have also launched an initiative that directly supports the families most hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. You can donate at <a href="http://www.grofers.com/donate">grofers.com/donate</a>.</li><li>We are also working with multiple other delivery partners to ensure they continue finding a livelihood.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/What-we-have-been-shipping-at-Grofers/0-p9jXyhD431exmvRb.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="What we have been shipping at Grofers" loading="lazy"></figure><p>There are more upcoming changes and initiatives we&#x2019;ll be launching as we find balance in this new reality.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="a-primer-on-setting-self-development-goals-using-okrs-and-a-guideline-to-do-it-the-right-way-">A primer on setting self-development goals using OKRs and a guideline to do it the right&#xA0;way.</h3><h2 id="making-a-contract-with-your-future-self">Making a contract with your future&#xA0;self</h2><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/2021/05/1-maz-9ku6jPZxXrIVLTOfkQ.jpeg" alt="Do You Need A Personal OKR?"><p>When we started using OKRs in Grofers, it was to ensure that we had a way of getting everyone on the same page around what was important towards our goals as a team and as a company.</p><p>This exercise taught us a lot and although we&#x2019;ve failed in every way imaginable, we continue to improve. In essence, OKRs are a written contract between our current self as an org and where we want to be in 3 or 6 months.</p><p>For an organization to be truly excellent, it&#x2019;s not just about working on the right things, it&#x2019;s also about the people doing those things. If you are doubling or tripling every year -as we have been for the past 3 years&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;the team also needs to be growing themselves at a commensurate rate.</p><blockquote>Professional or personal growth is not a hand-out and cannot be spoon-fed (even if you want to); it is something the learner needs to initiate and have ownership over. <a href="https://clicktotweet.com/Abxgp">Click to&#xA0;tweet.</a></blockquote><p>And once that initiative is taken, the organization is on the hook to provide resources and time but also to hold the learner accountable to their goal.</p><p>So just like for the org, we require each individual to define a self-development goal for themselves, a contract with their future self.</p><h2 id="a-mechanism-for-self-development">A Mechanism For Self-Development</h2><p>Most companies are afraid to give individuals the freedom to define their goals. They assume it will result in random or unrealistic goals. In our case, we do review them and have guidelines (cited below).</p><blockquote>There is a misconception that you can push learning on people. Using OKRs is a great way to get the team to take ownership of their own development which results in far greater ownership and creativity. <a href="https://ctt.ac/Q36yU">Click to&#xA0;tweet</a>.</blockquote><p>Often learning and development is not something that&#x2019;s too complex or time-consuming, it&#x2019;s just hard to remember with the day-to-day taking up our energy and time. We require everyone in the Grofers technology organization to update their OKRs every week.</p><p>Often they don&#x2019;t move, but since we have mechanisms already in place for reporting on company OKRs, it helps to keep personal ones&#x2019; top of mind.</p><h2 id="how-does-a-personal-okr-look-like">How does a personal OKR look&#xA0;like?</h2><p>Here are some examples of personal OKRs set by people at Grofers.</p><h3 id="objective-develop-a-better-understanding-of-golang-specifically-use-cases-around-k8s-and-high-performance-micro-services-"><strong>Objective: Develop a better understanding of Golang, specifically use cases around k8s and high-performance micro-services.</strong></h3><ul><li>KR #1: Contribute in 1 open-source project written in Golang</li><li>KR #2: Write a controller or CRD in Kubernetes for general purpose and open-source project</li></ul><h3 id="objective-become-a-better-design-leader"><strong>Objective: Become a better design&#xA0;leader</strong></h3><ul><li>KR #1: Read all 7 chapters of &#x201C;The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman&#x201D;</li></ul><h3 id="objective-build-my-capabilities-as-a-public-speaker"><strong>Objective: Build my capabilities as a public&#xA0;speaker</strong></h3><ul><li>KR #1: Do 3 mini-talks at internal knowledge sharing sessions</li><li>KR #2: Do 1 talk at a Grofers hosted open source meetup</li><li>KR #3: Get a talk accepted at a conference in 2020</li></ul><h2 id="the-3-point-guideline-to-personal-okrs">The 3-Point Guideline To Personal&#xA0;OKRs</h2><ol><li><strong>Don&#x2019;t be ambitious. </strong>Expect to spend about 12 hours in this quarter on it. That&#x2019;s just one hour per week. If your OKR is too ambitious, you wouldn&#x2019;t feel motivated to do it after a few days. The best personal OKRs form a sense of habit. For example, don&#x2019;t say you&#x2019;d read 3 books in a quarter. Instead, say you&#x2019;d read for 10 minutes every day.</li><li><strong>Keep it relevant. </strong>Make it easy to do along with your job.<strong> </strong>Pick something directly relevant to the work that you&#x2019;re doing or upcoming projects. This way it won&#x2019;t be a conflict to get it done and you can work with others.</li><li><strong>Do, don&#x2019;t &#x201C;learn&#x201D;. </strong>You should be able to measure completion and know what to do each week.

Grofers has grown by over 11x&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;from $60MM in GMV to nearly $700MM&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;in the last 24 months.</p><p>A big part of this success has been the ability of our team to go from idea to execution rapidly.</p><p>While we are leading the pack right now in terms of innovation and growth, we are competing offline with deep-pocketed giants like DMart and Reliance, and online with Alibaba (via Big Basket), Amazon and Walmart (via Flipkart).</p><p><strong>We cannot outspend&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;we must out-innovate.</strong></p><p>So I have two goals in my job: To <em>scale</em> and to <em>innovate</em>.</p><p>Unfortunately, these two goals are by nature opposing forces. The more people you add to systems, and the more complex you make those systems, the harder it is to move from idea to execution.</p><p>Ideas are not worth much now, there are few defensible positions and what few are there, do not remain long. It all comes down to who can differentiate fastest.</p><p>This article addresses how to scale the capabilities of a tech organization without adding too many people, or too many processes.</p><blockquote>How do we retain the speed of a cheetah, when we become the size of an elephant?How do we take an idea to execution in a day, and to one million customers the following week?<br></blockquote><p>The answer lies in both psychology and software. We&#x2019;ll start with the psychology, then a story, and end with software.</p><h2 id="the-psychology-of-self-determination">The Psychology of Self-determination</h2><p>The Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is a theory of what creates intrinsic motivation. While you can motivate people through reward and fear to some extent, innovation can only spring from intrinsic motivation&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;a desire to build for the sake of creative satisfaction and purpose.</p><p>SDT states that intrinsic motivation is comprised of three qualities:</p><ul><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: Allowing people to choose their methods, teams, and tasks.</li><li><strong>Mastery/Competence</strong>: The feeling of contentment that comes from success and growth.</li><li><strong>Purpose/Connectedness</strong>: A sense of belonging and connectedness with others.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/How-DevOps-Is-Making-Managers-Redundant-And-Why-That-s-a-Good-Thing/1-RsLNPH9rnC61NuJG2VbhqA.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="How DevOps Is Making Managers Redundant And Why That&#x2019;s a Good Thing" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Asif&#xA0;Jamal</figcaption></figure><p>This feels like common sense. So why are these often lacking in organizations, particularly scaled organizations? Process.</p><h2 id="the-process-paradox">The Process&#xA0;Paradox</h2><p>Even the most well-intentioned engineering and product leaders will hit a wall at some point of the organizational scale.</p><p>I&#x2019;m going to call it the &#x201C;Process Paradox:&#x201D;</p><blockquote>A small team with agile values will need processes to maintain those values as it scales. However, these processes will eventually become more powerful than the values they were trying to preserve. <a href="https://ctt.ac/1Gga6">Click to&#xA0;tweet.</a></blockquote><p>Or put another way:</p><ul><li>A large team without a process will get its focus only from a boss. At that point, the team no longer has intrinsic motivation and will not display creativity or agility.</li><li>A large team with too much process will lose sight of the outcome they are after and will lose their ability to <em>rapidly innovate and learn.</em></li></ul><h3 id="here-s-a-totally-realistic-example-">Here&#x2019;s a totally realistic example.</h3><h2 id="stage-1-the-garage">Stage 1: The&#xA0;Garage</h2><p>A long time ago, in a living room far, far away, a couple of motivated ex-colleagues and a 1/2 kilo of coffee spend a weekend hacking up the world&#x2019;s first canine space travel engine, AstroMutt.</p><p>In one weekend, they went from a stupid idea to a ReactJS, functional, serverless, AI-driven, crypto-compliant stupid idea to find interstellar rides for your beloved pet.</p><h2 id="stage-2-hackers-paradise">Stage 2: Hackers&#xA0;paradise</h2><p>Obviously they receive an eight-figure series A round the following Tuesday. Now, there is a team of 8 college friends and a VC who keeps talking about being more &#x201C;defensible.&#x201D;</p><blockquote>At this stage, &#x201C;process&#x201D; is essentially syncing up over beers to talk about what you did today and scrambling to prepare for some conference or investor pitch last minute.</blockquote><p><strong>And good things happen.</strong></p><p>New people get into different problems that interest them. They build rapidly&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;taking on all kinds of new technologies (without docs or support), deploying to cloud services (without tests), and generally gluing them all together (without standards).</p><blockquote>The big launch day happens, and since there is no market for this awful idea, they write a blog post which goes on Hacker News, and they receive a $50MM Series B.</blockquote><h2 id="stage-3-scaling-through-horizontal-teams">Stage 3: Scaling through horizontal teams</h2><p>Now this new VC isn&#x2019;t messing around. She wants dogs in space, and she wants them now. A few recruitment consultants are brought in and the ranks swell quickly to 40 engineers, product managers, designers, and marketing experts.</p><p>The system doesn&#x2019;t know how to handle all of these people. You can&#x2019;t really just hang out at the bar and discuss ideas with everyone, so they break them into teams.</p><p>One team for the backend, one for the mobile app, one for the website, one for the search engine, and one for infrastructure.</p><p>Soon, any given feature has to run through 4 teams that no longer get beers together anymore. There is uncertainty over who is responsible for what. Everyone is working, but nothing seems to gets released, and when it does, there are bugs and no one is sure who is responsible.</p><p>Everyone is still hacking away in their team with some <em>autonomy</em>, and within their team, there is some degree of <em>connectedness</em>. They may even get the sense that they are doing great work in their field and are getting recognized for their <em>competence</em>.</p><p>But the dogs are still sniffing butts right-side up. <strong>The results aren&#x2019;t coming.</strong></p><p>So more processes are added, and more people join the teams. We outsource QA to a company in some other country where dozens of people with exceptionally low levels of <em>autonomy</em> or sense of <em>competence</em> with no <em>connection</em> to the team or purpose are asked to &#x201C;find the bugs before release&#x201D;.</p><blockquote>Nothing improves here, because the releases just take longer to happen now that we have one more handoff. And code quality starts to dive as people are no longer responsible for their own terrible code.</blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s looking dire. The competition is coming, and CatLaunchr has built the first sub-orbital feline slingshot. The internet goes wild and Giffy IPOs at $20Bn.</p><p>Management changes and consultants come in, and now you&#x2019;ve got Scaled Agile Framework (TM, CSM, PMP, SOS, WTF, etc. etc&#x2026;)</p><h2 id="stage-4-agile-scrum-disjointed-teams-and-technical-debt">Stage 4: Agile, Scrum, disjointed teams and technical debt</h2><p>Okay, so even though you think the Agile coach dude is a sales agent for 3M stickies, it&#x2019;s still much better than before. The teams are split into x-functional units called pods. There is a search pod, a payments pod, an admin pod, etc&#x2026;</p><p>These pods can build independently, but they still have to release together. There are fewer handoffs between web and backend, but it still requires a lot of collaboration and manual QA.</p><blockquote>Now the teams still have the <em>autonomy</em> to work on whatever they want, but their sense of <em>competence</em> is waning. Every change to android requires coordination with the android engineers in every other pod.</blockquote><p>Their autonomy to release as and when is also hindered by the fact that in order to harden each release, they need to adhere to the sprint schedule. This means ending at the same time as everyone else so they can pass off the team of Zombie Manual Testers(ZMTs).</p><p>They don&#x2019;t invest in platforms and systems and cleaning up the old code, because that would delay their new features, and even if you wanted to, you&#x2019;d need to get everyone on board from all the pods, and there are too many meetings already.</p><p>But shit&#x2019;s getting done. Nothing amazing, but incremental improvements are starting to see the light of day sprint-by-sprint. There is a new tail length filter in search, you can specify in-flight kibble preferences, and you can pay using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a>.</p><h2 id="stage-5-scaling-by-adding-bodies">Stage 5: Scaling by adding&#xA0;bodies</h2><p>Now it&#x2019;s a job. People come in. People go out. They complain, they drink coffee&#x2026; the system is the way it is. Many things are done stupidly. There is never time to refactor, and we need to hire another 30 engineers yesterday.</p><p>Every person we add, every team we add, increases the complexities of collaboration and innovation becomes a distant memory of a happier time.</p><p>Remember, the Process Paradox?</p><blockquote>A small team with agile values will need processes to maintain those values as it scales. However, these processes will eventually become more powerful than the values they were trying to preserve. <a href="https://ctt.ac/nee70"><strong>Click to tweet.</strong></a></blockquote><h2 id="devops-as-underdog">DevOps as&#xA0;underdog</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/How-DevOps-Is-Making-Managers-Redundant-And-Why-That-s-a-Good-Thing/0-E1NZ_yAWOiiVNF-N.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How DevOps Is Making Managers Redundant And Why That&#x2019;s a Good Thing" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The Underdog</figcaption></figure><blockquote>DevOps: A catch-all term for tools and processes which allow for rapid, largely autonomous changes to a software&#xA0;system.</blockquote><p>This includes topics such as infrastructure provisioning, automated testing for defects, automated integration of various systems, logging and alerting, and getting performance data from the system.</p><p>The common idea is that DevOps investments are to increase the <em>reliability</em> of software development and the <em>speed</em> of releases. While this is true, I would argue that these are actually secondary benefits.</p><blockquote>The real benefit of a mature DevOps practice is the freedom it gives developers to innovate at the edges. <a href="https://ctt.ac/fHub6">Click to&#xA0;tweet</a>.</blockquote><p>Here are some ways the improvements to systems and better practices in development can solve for self-determination and unlock intrinsic motivation / radical innovation:</p><h3 id="automated-testing-autonomy-and-mastery">Automated testing&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Autonomy and&#xA0;mastery</h3><p>With a strong automated testing suite in place, teams have the <em>autonomy</em> to release as and when they complete something. They are also able to radically refactor code quickly, giving them a sense of <em>mastery</em>.</p><h3 id="continuous-integration-connectedness-and-autonomy">Continuous Integration&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Connectedness and&#xA0;autonomy</h3><p>A robust integration toolchain means multiple teams can stay synced up around status without meetings or project managers. This allows for complex multi-team innovation without a lot of central planning taking away <em>autonomy</em>.</p><h3 id="feature-flagging-phased-releases-and-a-b-testing-platform-mastery-and-autonomy">Feature flagging, phased releases, and A/B testing platform&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Mastery and&#xA0;autonomy</h3><p>When teams can release a new feature to a limited amount of users and measure results independently, an organization can run several experiments in parallel. This exponentially increases the chances that they will discover innovations faster than their competition.</p><h3 id="containerization-and-automated-environment-builds-autonomy-and-mastery">Containerization and automated environment builds&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Autonomy and&#xA0;mastery</h3><p>Making it easy for a developer to spin up custom staging environments means they are empowered to take greater risks and develop faster. Scripting deployments and infrastructure through tools like Ansible, Kubernetes, etc enable continuous deployment which frees up cycles for creative thinking instead of handling change.</p><h3 id="automated-event-analysis">Automated event&#xA0;analysis</h3><p>Automating monitoring and alerting frees up the team to work on new ideas. It makes releasing faster, requiring less up-front testing. Again, enhancing <em>autonomy</em> and <em>mastery</em></p><h2 id="the-long-tail">The Long&#xA0;tail</h2><blockquote>DevOps is putting management in code. It is automating the shitty meetings. <a href="https://ctt.ac/3sCX2">Click to&#xA0;tweet</a>.</blockquote><p>What?! Yes. That&#x2019;s what I said. DevOps as a school of thought and tools are there to replace the coordination and work quality check jobs that were traditionally done by managers.</p><p><em>How so?</em></p><p>Before we needed big group check-ins or PMs to release anything. However, with trunk-based development, multiple staging environments, and continuous integration, teams have greater visibility and don&#x2019;t need as many meetings.</p><p>Before contract testing, each repository owner would need to find out who managed each input or output to their service and coordinate changes.</p><p>Before feature flagging, we had to plan each release meticulously.</p><p>Now with trunk-based development, multiple staging environments, and continuous integration, teams have greater visibility and don&#x2019;t need as many meetings.</p><p>Rather than thinking of DevOps as a practice to enhance the productivity of developers, now I think of it as a way to deprecate the worst parts of management: the checker, the controller, the process cop.</p><blockquote>DevOps is the only way out of the Process&#xA0;Paradox.</blockquote><hr><p>If you&#x2019;re interested in learning more about Grofers and the work we are doing to create an elite agile team, please get in touch with me or attend one of our meetups (we run open-source meetups at our office regularly).</p><p>Open positions are listed <a href="http://grofers.careers/tech">here</a> and you can follow me (<a href="http://twitter.com/jacobsingh">@JacobSingh</a>) on Twitter.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jacobsingh.name/content/images/downloaded_images/How-DevOps-Is-Making-Managers-Redundant-And-Why-That-s-a-Good-Thing/1--xO0dSUvZe8xxRwdMqCiaA.gif" class="kg-image" alt="How DevOps Is Making Managers Redundant And Why That&#x2019;s a Good Thing" loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="jacob-singh-is-the-chief-technology-officer-at-grofers-"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobsingh/">Jacob Singh</a> is the Chief Technology Officer at&#xA0;Grofers.</h3><hr><h2 id="thanks-for-reading-lambda-">Thanks for reading&#xA0;Lambda.</h2><p>Say hello on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/groferseng">Twitter</a> or follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/grofers/">LinkedIn</a>.
