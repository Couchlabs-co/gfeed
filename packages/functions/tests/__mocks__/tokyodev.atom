    <content type="html">In 1985, Dungeons &amp; Dragons (hereafter referred to as D&amp;D) exploded onto the scene in Japan, achieving massive popularity. The Japanese version of the Basic Rule Set (known as the “red box”) sold an impressive 100,000 copies in its first year. The following year, the gaming magazine “Comptiq” published a series of articles titled _D&amp;D Magazine Live: Record of Lodoss War Replay_, which presented a full D&amp;D session in a narrative form. Inspired by these articles, the novelized series “Record of Lodoss War” went on to sell over 10 million copies.

Despite this auspicious beginning, D&amp;D's fortunes in Japan quickly declined. Today, it occupies a small niche within the Japanese tabletop role-playing game (commonly styled “TRPG” in Japan, “TTRPG” in the west) community. For example, the English version of “Player's Handbook 5th Edition” released in 2014 has sold over 1.5 million copies, but the Japanese one has sold fewer than 10,000 copies.

This article chronicles the rise and fall of D&amp;D in Japan and explores the lasting impact this iconic game has had on Japanese popular culture.


## D&amp;D arrives in Japan

In the first half of the 1980s, while D&amp;D was virtually unknown in Japan, derivatives of it such as computer role-playing games and gamebooks started to make inroads into Japanese popular culture.

On the computer gaming front, PC games such as Wizardry and Ultima were imported in the early 1980s. Then, in 1984, domestically produced PC role-playing games such as Hydlide, Dragon Slayer, and The Black Onyx were released, along with arcade games like The Tower of Druaga.

1984 also saw the release of the first gamebook in Japan, a translation of the Fighting Fantasy book “The Warlock of Firetop Mountain”. The book was a great success, [likely selling over 1,000,000 copies by 1987](https://twitter.com/yasudahitoshi2/status/1551034359171678208). This success sparked a gamebook boom.

The combination of the success of computer RPGs and gamebooks meant that around 1985, D&amp;D-style adventures and fantasy worlds had become popular in Japan and that there was a greater desire for more sword and sorcery adventures. Additionally, through introductory articles and similar materials, players became aware that these games were backed by a great system called D&amp;D.

This is when the Basic Rule Set arrived in Japan.


## The arrival of the Basic Rule Set

In June 1985, Shinwa Co., Ltd. released a Japanese translation of “Dungeons &amp; Dragons Set 1: Basic Rules”, edited by Frank Mentzer. The Basic Rule Set, being a boxed product, was distributed all over Japan in toy stores and hobby shops, which at the time also sold things like models and airsoft guns.

While D&amp;D wasn’t the first TTRPG released in Japan (Traveller had been translated for the Japanese market the previous year), it was a commercial success. [According to Hitoshi Yasuda](https://twitter.com/yasudahitoshi2/status/1162948566593101824), 100,000 copies of the Basic Rule Set were sold in the first year after its release, and [according to Kosaku Kawamoto](https://twitter.com/kaspart_j/status/571056406444400641), 200,000 copies had been sold by 1991.


## D&amp;D’s boom era

In September 1986, “Comptiq'' began serializing actual play sessions in _D&amp;D Magazine Live: Record of Lodoss War Replay_; this format was called “TRPG Replay” and it played an essential role in the Japanese TTRPG scene for almost 30 years. 

The best way to show people how to play and enjoy TTRPGs is to show them actual interesting gaming sessions. A recent example of this is how live streams such as "Critical Role" and "Dimension 20" have brought droves of new gamers to D&amp;D. TTRPG replays were a great way of doing this in an era when video streaming was not feasible.

_D&amp;D Magazine Live: Record of Lodoss War Replay_ reached tens of thousands of readers every month and D&amp;D’s popularity was exploding in Japan. By 1989, Sinwa Co. had released three boxed sets and more than 25 modules and accessories.

D&amp;D rules and adventures were provided by Sinwa Co. through toy stores, while translated novels in the D&amp;D world and introductions to the game were provided by Fujimi Shobo and Kadokawa Shoten through bookstores, creating an environment that fostered interest in both the world of D&amp;D and also playing games in that world.

Other imported TTRPGs were also being translated into Japanese, and Japanese authors were also producing TTRPGs, but it was due to serialized actual play articles and the supply of related products in bookstores that this era was probably the height of D&amp;D’s popularity in Japan.


## Group SNE's departure from D&amp;D

Kadokawa Shoten planned to publish _D&amp;D Magazine Live: Record of Lodoss War Replay_ in “Comptiq” and sell it as a paperback. However, there was an issue. TSR, the publisher of D&amp;D, allowed the publication of serialized actual play sessions, but prohibited those sessions from being compiled and sold as a paperback under the D&amp;D brand without their approval.

In an interview, Hitoshi Yasuda, the representative of Group SNE, said, "We made Record of Lodoss War because we wanted to promote D&amp;D, but TSR did not allow us to make Record of Lodoss War a part of D&amp;D [to promote and develop it].” According to [“‘Record of Lodoss War’ and Its Era”](https://www.kadokawa-zaidan.or.jp/product/301712000897.html), the situation was further complicated because D&amp;D in Japan was handled by two companies: the game itself was sold by Shinwa Co., Ltd., whereas peripheral materials such as replays and novels were handled by Kadokawa Shoten.

Group SNE wasn’t the only one in the Japanese market who faced issues with TSR. “A Book that Makes D&amp;D Easy to Understand”, which aimed to teach the Japanese audience about D&amp;D races, classes, weapons, armor, and equipment, as well as describing actual play in the form of TTRPG replays. While this book was eventually released in 1987, translations of it had to be sent to TSR for review, and it took two years of working with TSR for them to be satisfied with it.

Eventually "Record of Lodoss War" was published as a novel based on the sessions, without any use of the D&amp;D brand, and was a massive success. When Group SNE made a sequel to _D&amp;D Magazine Live: Record of Lodoss War Replay_, they switched from using the D&amp;D system to using their own original Record of Lodoss War RPG system.

The original series did make it to paperback eventually; however, it was in the form of a novel under the name "Record of Lodoss War." This and later sequels went on to become a huge hit, eventually reaching over 10 million copies in circulation. It would also be viewed as a pioneering work in the Japanese light novel genre, intended for readers in their late teens to 20s and characterized by the use of anime-like illustrations and an easy-to-read conversational style.


## The Rise of Paperback and Domestic TRPGs

In 1987, Tunnels &amp; Trolls by Flying Buffalo was translated by Group SNE and published by Shakai Shisousha, which sold 200,000 copies. Then in 1989, Sword World RPG, an original TTRPG designed by Group SNE, was published by Fujimi Shobo, and sold 500,000 copies, well surpassing the sales of D&amp;D itself in Japan. The success of these TTRPGs can be attributed to them being distributed as more accessible paperback books that were sold in bookstores all around the country, as opposed to the D&amp;D boxed sets that were only sold in niche hobby shops that were much rarer.

Publishers’ experiences with gamebooks gave them confidence to do large print runs of paperback rulebooks while keeping the unit price down, which led to a dramatic cost difference when compared to D&amp;D. D&amp;D’s Basic Rule Set was 4800 yen, but Tunnels &amp; Trolls was 680 yen and Sword World RPG was only 640 yen. 

Sword World RPG, which created an extensive domestic product line and was supported by local magazines, began to dominate the domestic scene as the flagship of Japanese TTRPGs.


## Failed Transition to AD&amp;D 2nd Edition

After completing the translation of the main D&amp;D products, Shinwa Co., Ltd. translated and published the three core rulebooks and some peripherals for "Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition" in 1991. Due to the small print run, the large amount of text to be translated, and a hardcover format, the prices were even higher than the previous edition: 6,800 yen for the Player's Handbook, 5,800 yen for the Dungeon Master's Guide, and 6,800 yen for the Monster Compendium.

As a result, the conversion of existing D&amp;D users was minimal, and only a handful of enthusiasts made purchases. Thus, the transition to AD&amp;D 2nd Edition failed, and Shinwa Co., Ltd.'s development of D&amp;D in Japan came to an end.


## Resurgence at MediaWorks

In 1994, MediaWorks brought Group SNE back to D&amp;D with a translation of “Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia.” For the first and only time in D&amp;D’s history in Japan, this translation involved extensive edits. Instead of being a large hardcover book, it was divided into paperbacks, the layout was changed, and the illustrations were replaced with original manga-like ones. The translation first published the rules for levels 1-9 in three books: “Players,” “Dungeon Masters,” and “Monsters,” along with translations of several campaigns. 

Potentially this could have been a chance for D&amp;D to reclaim the throne of TTRPGs in Japan, however Wizards of the Coast’s (WotC) acquisition of TSR in 1997 prevented the publication of future volumes of the Rules Cyclopedia, and interest in the product died off.


## D&amp;D 3rd Edition, Hobby Japan Era

In 2000, “Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition” was released by WotC and became a huge hit, and in 2002, Hobby Japan translated and published it. 

Over the next 20 years, Hobby Japan translated and published hundreds of D&amp;D products for the various editions, including 3rd Edition (over 100 products), 3.5 Edition (63 products), 4th Edition (42 products), and 5th Edition (16 products). Unlike the Rules Cyclopedia, these products were translated and published in the same format as the original products.

None of these products ever saw large-scale success. The person in charge of Hobby Japan said that the “Player’s Handbook” sold under 8000 copies for the 3rd Edition, over 6000 copies for the 3.5 Edition, just under 5000 copies for the 4th Edition, and just under 9000 copies for the 5th Edition.

Compared to the paperback TTRPGs published in Japan over the same period, these numbers are small. However, Hobby Japan continued to translate and sell these D&amp;D products due to  high-priced products (5000-6000 yen) that reliably sold about 3000 copies each time to a solid fanbase.

In June 2022, Hobby Japan’s involvement with D&amp;D came to an end, after WotC decided to take direct control of localized versions of D&amp;D.


## WotC Era

On July 1, 2022, [WotC's official Japanese D&amp;D website](https://dnd-jp.com/) opened, and WotC announced the release of the D&amp;D Starter Set, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Essentials Kit, and the Core Rules for Beginners. They also launched an unprecedented large-scale advertising campaign, including [an original Japanese promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmgsB6RDohU&amp;t=1705s), official videos created for the Japanese market explaining how to play D&amp;D, and videos of Japanese influencers playing the Starter Set. Some of these videos received hundreds of thousands of views.

In April 2023, they launched the "D&amp;D Learn-to-Play Program" for beginners at stores affiliated with the Wizards Play Network (WPN). This program sent a game kit and novelty items to interested stores and ran demonstration games in the store for 15-30 minutes. This event was to take place in 43 locations across Japan. Since the launch though, the number of WPN-affiliated stores in Japan hosting D&amp;D events have dwindled and can be counted on one hand.

2023 also saw the release of the Japanese release of the movie "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves" and PC game Baldur's Gate 3. Though both experienced a great deal of success in the Japanese market, no marketing tied them back to the core game itself, which seems like a wasted opportunity.

WotC seems to be trying to actively engage with the community in Japan by creating tags for fan content and player recruitment on social media and featuring them on their official account. From these tags, you can find actual play session streams by vtubers and streamers, character illustrations, original adventures, anime-style gameplay videos, and more. Some users even sell [Japanese adventure scenarios and supplements](https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?filters=0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1000156) on the DM’s Guild. 

I hope that through working with the community, D&amp;D in Japan will reach a new level.


## D&amp;D’s legacy on Japan pop culture

In Japan, while knowledge of D&amp;D has once again been relegated to a small group of enthusiasts, the impact of the game on Japan’s pop culture has been enormous.

Many of Japan’s best known fantasy properties can directly trace their lineage to the game. Final Fantasy’s original bestiary was [almost entirely lifted from D&amp;D](http://finalfantasy.istad.org/2013/01/final-fantasy-vs-dnd/). Popular light novels like Overlord, Goblin Slayer, and The Faraway Paladin are inspired by ideas from D&amp;D. This connection is so strong, that even though the author of the manga Delicious in Dungeon wasn’t aware of D&amp;D when she started penning the series, it feels as though it could be directly inspired by someone’s home campaign.

This influence means that even if the average Japanese person isn’t familiar with the name “D&amp;D,” they will be familiar with many of the tropes pioneered by the game.</content>

    <content type="html">“We’d love to have woman engineers on our team, but we don’t get any applying to us” is a common sentiment I’ve heard from startup founders, both in Japan as well as my home country, the United States.  

If you’re in a similar position, and looking to increase the gender diversity of your team, I have good news! Today I’m going to share strategies for not only attracting more women as candidates, but also helping you hire and retain them. These are strategies I’ve learned from 12+ years in software engineering roles, at companies from 3 to 20,000 people.

I’m also drawing on my experiences as Senior Director of [Women Who Code Tokyo](https://womenwhocode.com/network/tokyo), a chapter of a non-profit organization dedicated to helping women excel in tech careers. In addition, I’m sharing my learnings from reading and mentoring.

Before we dive in, let’s remember: Perfectionism is the enemy of progress. Just like we would with Agile software development, let’s aim to be better than we were yesterday, learn from mistakes, and move forward.

While this article primarily focuses on the balance between men and women, there are other important forms of diversity you should consider too: LGBTQIA+ (remember, gender diversity includes non-binary identities), nationality, race, disability, and more. 


## The four stages

I’ve broken the process of hiring more women into the following stages: 

1. Evaluate 
2. Attract
3. Hire
4. Retain

&lt;img src="https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjYzMjQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--6791858c545149697cb37ae4ec458ab71b7c9f40/unnamed.png" style="max-width: 320px"&gt;

Many companies start by looking to improve the Hire stage, but they haven’t put in the work to evaluate their current state of gender diversity or to make the company attractive to women. For this reason, they have limited or no success.

Let’s learn more about each stage.

## Stage 1: Evaluate

This stage involves an honest assessment of where your company is at with regards to gender diversity, as well as gathering more knowledge so your leadership is ready to support women.

### Understand why your company wants diversity

A good first question to ask is “why do we want diversity at our company?” (While there are certainly some companies that don’t understand or desire diversity, we assume that if you’ve read this far, you aren’t in that category 😃)

A caveat: let’s start by breaking the myth that women need rescuing, or that diversity initiatives are “charity” or “lowering the bar.”  

Reasons why some companies want diversity:

* Your team will more closely match your customer base, helping ensure your product fits the market, [according to the New York Times](https://open.nytimes.com/why-having-a-diverse-team-will-make-your-products-better-c73e7518f677).
* Diverse teams have a proven track record of better innovation and ideas, [according to an article by UC Berkeley](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_diversity_makes_us_smarter).
* Companies that bring together Japanese and foreign talent can better innovate in a competitive, global market.
* Diversity leads to fairer treatment, so everyone can succeed regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, caste, or creed.

### Identify barriers that might make women feel unwelcome

Once you understand your “why,” next, reflect on what barriers might make women feel unwelcome in your space. This one takes more introspection, so take your time and again, no perfectionism! Look for areas to improve in.

* Does the company have a rigid work schedule or lots of overtime? Family obligations fall disproportionately on women, [according to TIME Magazine](https://time.com/6310501/japan-women-unpaid-labor-equality/), so an inflexible schedule may prevent them from thriving in your organization. A [2018 article by Tomohiro Takami](https://www.jil.go.jp/english/jli/documents/2018/011-02.pdf) asserts that “‘overtime culture’ is a barrier to women playing active roles at a company.” Consider flexible schedules to allow for activities throughout the day, such as childcare dropoff/pickup, or allow working from home to care for sick family members. Also consider flexibility across longer durations for life events such as maternity and paternity leaves.
* What kind of language do people use in the office? Masculine language like “war rooms,” “dominate,” and “guys” may create an unwelcoming atmosphere. Sexual slang or “locker room talk” needs to be nipped in the bud. Interestingly, I’ve known a lot of men who also find such topics exhausting.
* How does the team socialize or build culture? If it’s only late nights with heavy drinking, women may feel uncomfortable. Parents may not be able to stay out late on a weeknight. While getting beers with the team can be fun on occasion, consider having different opportunities for people to build relationships, such as getting a team lunch. Make sure that all events have non-alcoholic choices.


### Educate yourself about gender equity in the workplace

This article is just an introduction to the topic of gender equity in the workplace, and others have written more extensively about it. In particular, I recommend “[The Good Guys](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50674178-good-guys),” which shows that men have a crucial role in promoting gender equity at work, and “[What Works for Women at Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17920210-what-works-for-women-at-work?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=NwMqN34qnj&amp;rank=1)” by Joan C. Williams and Rachel Dempsey. 

### Be ready to challenge assumptions 

One question I’ve faced when discussing measures to combat gender equity in the workplace is: “Are we lowering the bar?”

I find this question to be loaded, and only raise it here to respond to it clearly. The reason it’s loaded: it assumes that we live in a meritocracy with fair hiring systems; it assumes that women are less apt at science and mathematics; it assumes that hiring women is some misguided charity, and that DEI efforts are some band-aid, feel-good fix.

To this I’ll point to the excellent book “[Brotopia: Breaking up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36288143-brotopia),” in which Emily Chang breaks down the origins of the word “meritocracy,” and explains how Computer Science transitioned from a field of women typists and “human calculators” to a male-dominated industry.

But this may also shock you to hear me say: I don’t want your company to hire unqualified women. It does no favors to your company, and it also doesn’t help the woman who is chosen for a role she can’t succeed in. Nobody wins!

There are also myths that technically proficient women don’t exist, or that women have an easier time getting through interviews. Let’s be cautious about any assumptions that take a zero-sum approach to gender relations—women’s success does not mean men lose something; there is a future where everyone can succeed. We’ll also leverage scientific research as well as firsthand experience rather than generalizations.

## Stage 2: Attract

The next stage is to adjust your company’s external strategy to ensure you are appealing to women candidates. Check if you are accidentally sending signals that may turn away women.


### Create inclusive job postings

Job postings are often candidates’ first chance to learn about your company, and so it is essential that they make them feel welcome. Here are some tips on writing inclusive job postings.


#### Avoid assuming a gender in the description

Instead of writing “The candidate will design software systems in **his** day-to-day work…” you could use the gender-neutral “their,” or instead change the listing to use the second-person “you.”


#### Avoid buzzwords when describing employees

Cutesy nicknames like “rockstar,” “hacker,” and “ninja” not only turn away women, they also harken back to the early 2010s.


#### Keep requirements to those that are absolutely essential

Extremely long lists of requirements that may actually be optional can scare away women. It’s better to think about what’s required vs. nice to have in your listing. Women tend to self-select out of job postings when they don’t meet 100% of the requirements, whereas men apply if they meet at least 60%, [according to a HBR article](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified).


#### When referring to women, be careful about the term you use

Pay attention to the terms you use when referring to women, or your attempts to be welcome to them may backfire. Here are some nuances to be mindful of when referring to women:



* “Women”: Used to refer to adult women in the noun or adjective form.
* “Girls”: Refers to female children. While it may be used in an endearing manner in social or casual settings, such as “Girls’ Night,” avoid using this in professional settings as it is diminutive.
* “Female”: Avoid using this as a noun, as it sounds overly biological and can refer to animals. It could be used as an adjective, though I prefer “women.”\\
  “We want to hire more _females._” =&gt; “We want to hire more **women.**”

#### Further resources for creating inclusive job posts

For examples of what inclusive hiring posts do look like, check out [this blogpost by Gem Siocon](https://blog.ongig.com/diversity-and-inclusion/inclusive-job-descriptions/). You can also use the free tool [Gender Decoder](https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/) to check your job post for inclusive language.


### Ensure your employer branding promotes gender diversity

Review your company’s employer branding from the perspective of gender diversity. A woman is more likely to want to join an organization that’s already making strides to improve their diversity than one that is male-dominated and showing no efforts to improve.


#### Highlight any existing gender diversity

Even if your organization is male-dominated, chances are there are some women in your organization. Work with them to figure out ways you can highlight them. This can include encouraging them to speak at events (along with providing them the resources to do so) or featuring their profiles on your website. Note that not all women will be comfortable with doing this, so be careful about pressuring them to do this.


#### Avoid appearing in events that lack gender diversity

Unfortunately it is all too common for events in Japan to feature all-male panels, or for conferences to have a dozen speakers without a single woman. Should your company appear in one of these, you may lead women to think that your organization doesn’t value them.

If one of your male employees is invited to speak at such an event, raise this issue with the organizer. If there’s a woman in your organization who would be a good fit, consider suggesting her instead. Otherwise, you can ask the organizer to find a qualified woman on the desired topic through a resource like [SpeakHer](https://speakher.jp), something I built with Tutti Quintella and Yan Fan.

Is your company leadership hosting or speaking at events with all-male panels? Are most of the photos on your LinkedIn groups of men?


#### Participate in, sponsor, or partner with organizations that promote diversity

There are some great opportunities to get involved with women and girls in tech. Here are a couple organizations operating in Tokyo, many of which are welcoming to male allies:

* [Women Who Code](https://womenwhocode.com/network/tokyo) - A global nonprofit dedicated to empowering women in tech careers. Events are free and open to all genders. Most events are in English.
* [Code Polaris](https://code-polaris.connpass.com/) - A Japanese-language organization supporting women in tech.
* [Waffle](https://waffle-waffle.org/) - A Japanese NPO supporting high school and college girls in technology.
* [FEW Japan](https://fewjapan.com/) - Though not a technical organization, they are a great group supporting women leaders and entrepreneurs in Japan.
* [Women in Agile Japan](https://www.wiajapan.org/) - An Japanese-language community aiming to create 100 women Agile leaders in Japan.
* [Women in Technology Japan](https://womenintech.jp) - A local community supporting women in tech fields, with many international members.


## Stage 3: Hire

Congratulations! You’ve reached the stage where you’ve got women applying to your company! Now how to shape your hiring process to find candidates who are a good fit.

### Review your hiring process for implicit bias

The first step is to review your hiring process for [implicit bias](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicit-bias/): where we make unintended actions based on stereotypes or prejudice. There are many studies that show that better rubrics and systems help remove bias and improve decision-making.

To do this, ask: “_Is our current hiring process designed to help us hire people who are a good fit for [role]?_”

Processes often favor candidates based on factors that have nothing to do with their aptitude for the role. For instance, I have ground my teeth in hiring meetings listening a male colleague fawn over an interview candidate who “was such a great culture fit, I would love to get a beer with him.” 

If you are in the business of consuming beer, please, go ahead and hire that guy. As for me, I’m in the business of creating great software, so I’d like the evaluation criteria to measure:

* Technical foundations
* Problem solving
* Communication
* Leadership (depending on level)
* Collaboration/Teamwork
* Ability to take feedback/Coachability
* Testing/Quality mindset

Avoid “culture fit” or [affinity bias](https://diversityjournal.com/13763-affinity-bias-conundrum-illusion-inclusion-part-iii/) and instead look to “[cultural additions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrock/2021/04/30/cultural-fit-hasnt-been-working-what-about-culture-add/?sh=58ab6cb929fe).” Look for people who will nudge your culture in a healthy direction. Coach your team in collaboration and feedback so they can bridge differences in a constructive manner.

### Offer equal pay for equal work

It may be surprising that pay equity is still an issue in 2024, but [last year’s Nobel Prize in economics went to Claudia Golden who studied this very issue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/09/claudia-goldin-nobel-economics-prize-gender-pay-gap). [Nikkei Asia also discusses the gender pay gap in a recent article](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Datawatch/Japan-s-greedy-work-practices-blamed-for-gender-pay-gap), where they talk about how a “greedy” work culture that demands long hours makes it hard for women to remain in higher paying jobs. In the west, women have less success than men in negotiating their salary.

One challenge in Japan is the expectation that applicants provide their current compensation. Basing future salaries based on past values could perpetuate pay inequity. Nonetheless, there is hope: a [Harvard Study from 2014](https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/do-women-avoid-salary-negotiations-evidence-large-scale-natural-field-experiment) suggests that by giving women permission to negotiate in hiring discussion, the wage gap closes.


### Hire women at various levels at your company

Remember, women aren’t only beginners. Having women in senior positions can demonstrate to potential hires that there is room for them to grow in the organization. It also establishes role models, and ensures that women’s voices are included in decision-making.


## Stage 4: Retain

By this point your company is becoming more diverse. This step is about setting up your new hires for success, so they excel at your company, which will both help your product and make it easier to attract even more diverse talent.


### Provide opportunities for mentorship

**Mentoring** is a really great way to grow your talent, produce better employees, and also keep people engaged. Larger companies may have enough opportunity to offer mentorship programs. While it can be helpful for women to have female role models at their company, having a male mentor can also be a great opportunity for both participants. 

Even if you are a smaller company, consider external mentorship opportunities to develop your people. [ADPList](https://adplist.org/) is an awesome site that connects mentees and mentors around the world, and it’s completely free.

### Recognize growth through promotion

Provide opportunities for evaluation and growth, and be sure to recognize outstanding work accordingly. You can use the same techniques for mitigating bias in hiring to evaluate your promotion cycle. Consider the chapters on “Prove-it-again” bias from [What Works For Women at Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17920210-what-works-for-women-at-work), which discusses a phenomenon where men are evaluated on potential, while women are expected to demonstrate past experience. Understanding these patterns helps us identify and mitigate it.

One of the best ways to support women in their career is through **sponsorship**: when a leader champions someone through the promotion process. [Studies show](https://hbr.org/podcast/2010/08/women-are-over-mentored-but-un) that sponsorship more than mere mentorship helps women thrive in their careers.

### Support [DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion) internally

Internal support of DEI is another factor that keeps women happy at their company. Small companies with little budget can bootstrap DEI programs thanks to [free allyship training from LeanIn.org](https://leanin.org/allyship-at-work). As companies grow, many form Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) as a way of supporting initiatives and creating a sense of belonging. These tend to succeed more when the leadership of such works is categorized as real work for the organization rather than just volunteering. This means supporting DEI as part of the organization’s “currency” and setting expectations around time commitments. For larger companies, full-time staff supporting DEI can supplement part-time members and compensate for the emotional labor behind this work.


### Establish HR processes

Lack of HR / immature processes is a challenge in smaller organizations (or even those going through transition). Nonetheless, this is a risk area that is good to prepare for. 

Ensure you have mediation tools for healthy conflict resolutions. Avoidance will just push off things to the future, usually coming back in a worse form. An excellent book on this subject is [Crucial Conversations](https://cruciallearning.com/browse-courses/crucial-conversations-for-dialogue/)

### Provide parent-friendly policies

While parent-friendly policies can be good for employees regardless of gender, women often disproportionately benefit from them, both because of the physical burdens that pregnancy and childbirth place on them, but also because of societal expectations that are often placed on mothers.


#### Establish lactation spaces

Lactating mothers need privacy, calm, and a sanitary space to pump breast milk, otherwise they may experience intense pain, and their baby may not get proper nutrition. The women’s restroom isn’t sufficient—nobody wants to prepare their meal in the toilet. Also make sure your staff understand that the lactation space is a restricted space—interruptions such as coworkers barging into the door looking for a conference room, or interns using the space to take naps can cause mothers undue stress and may prevent them from pumping. 


#### Allow parents to work flexibly

Parents may need to work remotely to take care of sick kids or arrange dropoff/pickup from daycare or school


#### Train managers about maternity leave

Despite its legal protections, [Japan still struggles with マタハラ](https://www.vice.com/en/article/kb4ddv/women-in-japan-maternity-harassment-matahara) (_matahara_, maternal harassment), where women face professional consequences for getting pregnant. Make sure your managers are trained to make applying for leave an easy process.


#### Promote paternity leave

Under the law, fathers are provided paternity leave. Encourage them to take advantage of it, because it normalizes men sharing duties that stereotypically fall to women.


#### Prohibit overtime

Expectations of overtime tend to favor men, who are more likely to have a wife to take care of household duties such as cleaning, cooking, and childcare. Even when both partners in heterosexual couples work, there is often an expectation that the woman takes on a larger share of the household duties (known as “[The Second Shift](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310593/the-second-shift-by-arlie-hochschild-with-anne-machung/)”). Setting reasonable work hours helps level the playing field, and may have added benefits of preventing burnout among all employees.


## Putting it all together

Now that we’ve learned the four steps, what’s next? Remember, DEI is a journey, not a destination. Celebrate your successes, and keep growing. Look for ways your organization can support [intersectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) diversity, such as LGBTQIA+, disability, neurodiversity, and nationality or culture.

Lastly, I’d like to thank you for reading this article. For caring, reflecting, and doing the work to make the Tokyo tech environment more inclusive. I hope to see you at a future event.

      <name>Johannes Mario Meissner</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">My journey in Japan began with an unconventional scholarship program called Vulcanus in Japan, which allowed me to take a Japanese language course and intern at a major Japanese company. I wrote all about it in [my previous TokyoDev article](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/my-experience-with-vulcanus-in-japan).

This time, I wanted to describe the continuation of this journey, a master’s program in computer science at the University of Tokyo.


## How I ended up in a graduate program

While still in the middle of my Vulcanus program in Japan, I was offered a scholarship from a Spanish bank that would cover the tuition fees for any international graduate school program and provide a monthly stipend. I originally aimed to get accepted into one of the highly-regarded American universities.

However, things didn’t turn out as I expected. The COVID-19 pandemic hit right around when the admissions process was closing, and international travel became extremely difficult. Not surprisingly, I couldn’t make my original plans work, so I shifted my attention back to Japan. One of the few universities still accepting applications was the University of Tokyo, so I took my chances and went all in for this last opportunity.

## I was lucky to pass the entrance exam

The entrance examination for most programs at the University of Tokyo is known to be very challenging. This is especially true for the highly in-demand computer science graduate program.

The written exam for the computer science degree is usually divided into a computer science section and a math section. Past exam iterations are made public for you to review and prepare, but the breadth of content is so wide that realistically, at least half a year of full-time preparation would be needed to be comfortable with all the topics included. I locked myself into my room and studied for months, praying that this or that topic would be kept out of the exam.

Math was definitely a major weakness for me, and my chances of doing well on that one were almost zero. However, the planets aligned for me, and it was decided that due to the extraordinary circumstances (COVID), the math exam would be replaced with an additional oral examination covering computer science topics. Imagine my excitement!

While I did okay on the written exam, my strong performance on the oral exam was ultimately the decisive factor for my admission into the program. To this day, I consider myself extremely lucky for how things turned out.


## Graduate programs in Japan are all about research

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://assets.tokyodev.com/tokyodev-production-r2/theqr66pg1xtctj2netiexjbtbht" alt="The Hongo campus in Autumn. Students walk on yellow ginko leaves."&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;The Hongo campus in Autumn is gorgeous.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

Most graduate programs in Japan are two-year long, highly research-focused programs. When applying, you not only select the degree program, but also a research laboratory. **Most of your time will be dedicated to research activities in the lab, including weekly lab meetings and tasks that your professor asks you to do.** You’ll be encouraged to write papers, participate in competitions and events, and share your knowledge and results with others.

This might vary among universities and programs, but in my case, the amount of required coursework credits was fairly low, and most classes were not very challenging. It is possible to finish all required coursework credits within one or two semesters and have your second year fully dedicated to your research and thesis.

**Given this tendency for graduate schools in Japan to be so research-focused, whether or not you enjoy it will depend mostly on your inclination toward research.** Graduate school might be overwhelming if you are looking for a quick way to earn credentials for job hunting.

Finally, learning all you can about your prospective professor before applying to the program is very important. Some are very relaxed and don’t ask much from their students, while others are extremely demanding and will expect you to work 10 hours per day while publishing something every other month. Make sure when picking a professor that you pick one who matches you not only in research topic but also in work style.

## You won’t fit in as a foreigner, but that’s okay

You probably won’t be surprised to hear that fitting in with Japanese students is very hard, as they will mostly form closed groups among themselves. You might have more luck among your lab-mates, especially those comfortable with using English. I made several Japanese friends myself through this approach. On the plus side, you will most likely not be the only foreigner in your degree, especially if it’s an English-based program, so there will be many like-minded foreigners to befriend. Finally, you will also find it helpful to participate in extra-curricular activities such as sports, competitions, on-campus concerts, etc.

My graduate school made no particular distinction between English-speaking international students and Japanese students. Courses in both languages are mixed into the same curriculum, and everyone is free to choose between both. For that reason, it is easy for international students to choose their level of comfort with Japanese and take steps accordingly, such as collaborating with the Japanese students of your lab or joining a Japanese-language course. I personally didn’t find myself comfortable enough to follow a high-speed Japanese lecture, so I stayed on the English side. Looking back, I wish I had pushed myself a little more. The labs are also usually fairly multilingual. Most professors will talk to you in English if that’s what you prefer.

With that said, this can vary from program to program. If your program is tailored fully toward foreign students, you might not find the chance to interact with Japanese students. It’s best to contact currently enrolled students if you want to know more about those details before applying.


## **I had a blast, and so might you**

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="
https://assets.tokyodev.com/tokyodev-production-r2/p9mnwohud2a74pdrh4944v4dmzl1" alt="A snowman in front of a fountain with a building in the background."&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;We built a snowman in front of the library.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

My experience as a master’s student at the University of Tokyo was extremely unique due to COVID-19. Most courses—and even lab activities—shifted to a remote system. Given how charming the Hongo campus is, I felt quite sad not being able to make the most of it. With that said, I had one in-person course that I really enjoyed, and there are multiple facilities that students can make use of, such as the library and the gym.

My lab was large, with almost 15 active students participating in the weekly activities. My favorite was the paper reading sessions, where each week, one student presented a paper on a related topic. There was a significant number of foreign students, and most activities were carried out in English.

Thanks to the great lab environment, excellent supervisor support, and an eagerness to make something out of this program, I published two research papers at high-profile conferences ([Debiasing Masks: A New Framework for Shortcut Mitigation in NLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16079) and
[Embracing Ambiguity: Shifting the Training Target of NLI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03020)). The first of those conferences was unfortunately fully online (thanks again, COVID!), but I was able to participate in-person in Abu Dhabi for the second one. The lab will usually provide financial support for activities like these and cover the associated costs.


## A degree from a Japanese institution can be valuable in Japan




&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjU0NzksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--5ce42fb54b064109bf46cd4bd39b5a4e20b7ef27/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="Johannes in academic regalia"&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;My graduation day!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


A Japanese degree will greatly boost your job-hunting in Japan. It is a sign that you have spent two years in the country, been able to enroll in a local institution, and followed its rules and norms. Any Japanese company looking at your resume will feel more confident about you being able to blend into their workforce, too. If your university has some amount of prestige, then that will additionally reflect on you as a graduate.

Notably, Japanese companies usually don’t expect much from the actual outcomes of your degree. Your research topic or academic performance will have little impact if any at all. A staggering number of Japanese graduates work jobs that have nothing to do with the field they majored in. History major, applying for an investment analyst position? All good!

Internationally, a Japanese degree is usually not as well recognized as they are not very well known. I would consider them to be at a similar level of recognition to an average European university.


## Is this the right choice for you?

If you have the time, are willing to dive deeper into the academic research world, and plan to continue working in Japan, a master’s degree with a Japanese institution would be a great option for you. You will most likely have a great time and the degree will offer a significant boost in your job hunting.

If any of the above is not true, however, there are several other options to consider. Professional training programs or technical schools (専門学校, _senmon gakkou_), boot camps, and several other similar paths exist that can boost your credentials in Japan. However, if you are not planning to pursue a job in Japan, a degree with better international recognition might be a better choice.

One final reason to consider a Japanese graduate school is that it can be a way into the country if you are applying from abroad. Universities will sponsor a student visa for all international students, so it’s an easy option to set foot in Japan and use your time as a student to figure out your next steps.

Personally, my choice of joining graduate school in Japan definitely paid off. Not only did I achieve several strong research outcomes, but I also had a great time doing so and finally landed a great job after graduation. I think back fondly on my time as a student in Japan due to the many friends and unforgettable memories I was able to make.

    <title>How I obtained a J-FIND visa in Japan</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/how-i-obtained-japan-s-j-find-visa"/>

    <content type="html">The J-Find Visa enables recent graduates to engage in activities such as job hunting, business startup, and other income-generating endeavors within Japan — opportunities that were previously inaccessible to do so. I was one of the first recipients of this visa, which provided me with the legal foundation to reside in Japan for the initial year, allowing me to make pivotal connections, lay the groundwork for starting a business, open a bank account, secure housing, and more. 

This article highlights my personal experiences with the J-Find Visa and how the Tokyo One-Stop Business Establishment Center ([TOSBEC](https://www.startup-support.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/onestop/en/)) has played a crucial role in helping me overcome challenges associated with these endeavors.

## Why I embarked on this journey


My childhood fascination with Japan reached new heights in 2019. That year, I had made several trips to Japan during the spring, summer, and winter, immersing myself in the culture and lifestyle. Particularly exciting for me, given my background as a graduate in Communications and Japanese Linguistics from the University of Zurich. That last winter trip was especially impactful, thanks to a homestay with a lovely 73 year young grandmother in Kanazawa, Ishikawa-Prefecture. However, in February 2020, my journey encountered an unexpected turn when COVID necessitated my return to my hometown of Zurich.

There I was, a graduate student, with part-time working experience as a Marketing Manager and Communications Consultant, albeit over many years. I did not have a lot of choices back then. In this period of uncertainty, I decided to get a Master's Degree (post-grad) in Communications and Linguistics, a decision that not only advanced my academic credentials but also helped me refocus on my goal of returning to Japan. 

When Japan's borders reopened in October 2022, I took the opportunity and returned in February 2023 on a regular tourist visa, staying for five months. To work around the limitations of the tourist visa, which typically allows for a stay of up to 90 days, I temporarily left Japan to visit Seoul after the initial three months on my visa. I then re-entered Japan, which effectively reset my visa and allowed me an additional three months in the country. This approach served as an alternative to formally applying for a tourist visa extension within Japan.


## Choosing the right visa

This time, my objective was clear, and I was ambitious: I wanted to start my own Communications business in Tokyo. The main obstacle in my path, however, was obtaining a suitable visa. I evaluated several options:


### 1. Language school enrollment

While this path could have provided me with a student visa, ultimately leading to a working visa, it was not a viable option for me. Having already graduated in Japanese studies as my minor, I was not ready to return to a classroom setting. My focus was on practical application and moving forward in my career.


### 2. Seeking employment

Given the financial barriers associated with the already well-known [Business Manager Visa](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/obtaining-a-business-manager-visa-in-japan), my plan involved obtaining a regular working visa as a stepping stone to starting my own business. The job search process, however, proved to be a major hurdle. Despite numerous applications and interviews, I constantly faced the same issue: companies were reluctant to sponsor my visa without prior work authorization in Japan. Although my ability to network and forge connections as a Communications professional led me to various business owners, none were able to assist with my visa situation. This emotional rollercoaster was marked by enthusiastic initial responses that often dissipated, leaving follow-up plans unmaterialized.


### 3. Government's Visa Initiative 

And then, it happened. End of April 2023 marked a crucial moment in my journey, as the Japanese government announced the innovative J-FIND and J-SKIP visa programs. This groundbreaking development presented a ray of hope, cutting through the complexities of traditional visa routes. Made for self-sponsoring individuals, this visa opened up a new niche in Japan's business landscape: Freelance Entrepreneurs. With the advent of the J-FIND and J-SKIP visa programs, my strategy took a significant turn. This initiative not only aligned perfectly with my goals but also simplified the process of establishing my business in Japan, or so I thought at first. I shifted my focus to this self-sponsored visa, recognizing it as a practical and direct route to realizing my entrepreneurial ambitions in Tokyo.

With the rollout of the J-FIND and J-SKIP visa programs, I was presented with a choice. The J-SKIP option, however, was impractical for me due to its requirement of an annual income exceeding 20 million yen. Being a couple of million yen short of this threshold, I realized that this path was not viable for my situation, steering me towards the J-FIND visa as the only suitable and feasible option.


## What is the J-FIND visa?

To me, the path to securing the novel J-FIND visa was one that necessitated thorough research and a keen understanding of the required documentation. The Japanese government aims to draw in younger, highly skilled, and well-experienced foreign professionals through its new visa initiatives. This move is in response to Japan's urgent need to counterbalance its swiftly aging population and persistently low birth rates, which have led to a critical shortage in the workforce. While Japan's immigration approach has historically been somewhat closed off, often not aligning with the dynamics of the global market, these new measures indicate Japan's awareness of the growing necessity to welcome international businesses and talents.

So, while the J-SKIP visa expands upon the existing Highly Skilled Professional (HSP) visa program, the J-FIND visa introduces a new category as a part of Japan's economic revitalization strategy. Permitted activities under the J-FIND visa included job hunting, start-up preparation, and employment to supplement funds for these primary activities.

But one of the initial challenges I encountered was the novelty of the J-FIND visa program. Being a new and untested option, there were no law firms or agencies equipped with the experience to guide applicants through this specific process.


## Visa Requirements

As I did my research, I found that to qualify for this visa, applicants were required to fulfill the following:

*	**Educational Background:** A degree from a university ranked in the top 100 in at least two world university rankings, or completion of a graduate course at such an institution.
*	**Timeliness of Graduation**: The visa application needed to be made within five years of graduating, as the target is recent graduates.
*	**Financial Preparedness**: A minimum of 200,000 yen for initial living expenses in Japan, evidencing the applicant's capability to support themselves initially.

Meeting these requirements was necessary for my application. Fortunately, my educational background aligned perfectly with the criteria, and I had graduated within the stipulated time frame. Additionally, I had secured enough funds to meet the financial requirement for initial living expenses in Japan. The only downfall of the visa seemed to be the limited duration: it is initially valid for a maximum of one year and can be renewed only once for an additional year. Contrary to what some might believe, this visa is not intended for 'digital nomads.' Instead, it serves as a business preparation visa, designed to facilitate the initial stages of establishing a business in Japan.


## Applying for the J-FIND visa


### Step 1: The Certificate of Eligibility

The next obstacle I faced was obtaining a Certificate of Eligibility (CoE), which typically requires a sponsor in Japan, such as an employer, school, or relative. Without any of these in place, the conventional route to a CoE was not an option for me. And I needed the CoE in order to apply for the visa in the first place.

This is where the J-FIND (and J-SKIP) visa offered a distinct advantage. Unlike other visas, it allowed me to be my own guarantor, a significant deviation from the standard requirement. The process of obtaining a CoE within Japan generally takes 1 to 3 months and requires a Japanese address for correspondence. Because the J-FIND visa was a new and unknown territory to all involved stakeholders at that time, I was not allowed to apply for the CoE overseas at the Japanese Embassy of Switzerland. To navigate this requirement, I later used the address of my best friend in Japan, a decision I transparently communicated to the immigration authorities, while I was in Tokyo.


### Step 2: Preparing the Documents

This stage required thorough organization and attention to detail, as the completeness and accuracy of these documents are critical for a successful application. What I needed to prepare were following documents to apply for the CoE: 

*	CoE application form
*	One photograph (that meets the standard requirements)
*	Documents proving that I had graduated from a university ranked in the top 100 in at least two world university rankings
*	My Curriculum Vitae
*	A description of intended activities (here I had mentioned the J-FIND visa)
*	A document showing my current balance of my savings account


### Step 3: Applying for CoE at Shinagawa, Tokyo

I headed to the immigration office in Shinagawa, Tokyo, to submit my CoE application. Fortunately, I had digitized copies of my important documents stored on my laptop, which made it easier to print them out at a nearby 7-Eleven. This step was all about ensuring that every required piece of paper was in order, accurately filled out, and ready for submission. 

Surprisingly, even the staff at the immigration office were not fully acquainted with the J-FIND visa, a testament to its novelty. I had to explain the new visa to the staff, using the official government website as a reference. I think this was one of the biggest challenges in the whole process, because it seemed to me as if everyone was lost: the staff didn't know the visa, and the lack of familiarity with the J-FIND visa left me questioning whether my application would be processed correctly, or if I would receive any response at all.


### Step 4: The Wait

Following the submission of my CoE application, a period of waiting ensued. One month passed without any news, and I made the decision to return to Zurich in June. This move was rather strategic, allowing me to prepare for what I hoped would be my relocation to Japan. In July, my best friend came to visit family in Zurich. When we met, I was faced with an unexpected but welcome surprise: he was holding a yellow-ish letter, the harbinger of good news. It was my Certificate of Eligibility, finally in my hands.


### Step 5: Japanese Embassy in Bern, Switzerland

With the Certificate of Eligibility, I wasted no time in progressing to the next step. I immediately contacted the Japanese embassy the following Monday and secured an appointment for Friday the same week. The embassy did not accept online submissions for visa applications, so I prepared to present my documents in person. To my relief and excitement, I received notification after just one week: my J-FIND visa was approved and ready for collection. I promptly visited the embassy again, and there it was, my visa firmly attached to my passport. End of July, I found myself in Tokyo.


## Challenges after re-entering Japan: banking and housing hurdles

Upon re-entering Japan with my new visa, I encountered two significant challenges that again tested my resilience and adaptability. 


### Challenge 1: Opening a personal bank account

Contrary to the usual straightforward process of opening a bank account in Japan, my situation was overly complicated by the unique nature of the J-FIND visa. The typical routes to a bank account in Japan include 1) being accompanied by an employer / lawyer on the first day of work, 2) having a school as a guarantor for students, or 3) residing in Japan for over six months. The J-FIND visa, while permitting work, job seeking, and business setup, paradoxically complicated the process of opening a bank account. Despite having an official statement attached to my passport confirming my eligibility to work and start a business, the barriers of trust persisted.


#### Solution

The solution eventually came from an unconventional approach. I declared myself self-employed on paper, which technically aligned with my freelancer and sole-proprietor status. To my surprise, this strategy worked, and I was able to open a personal bank account after five ridiculous months. Throughout the initial bank-less period, I relied on WISE International for financial transactions, ensuring I could pay rent and meet daily expenses.


### Challenge 2: Renting a Place in Tokyo

My inability to open a Japanese bank account initially prevented me from renting an apartment in the conventional manner. Share houses were not a viable option for me, and the requirement for a Japanese bank account to rent a place posed a significant hurdle. 


#### Solution:

Eventually, I found a solution through [Weave Living](https://www.weave-living.com/en/jp/), a foreigner-friendly real estate company specializing in move-in ready and fully furnished apartments with design-forward furniture and appliances. They offered a reasonable price and accepted credit card payments from foreign banks, providing me with a much-needed temporary housing solution in Tokyo.


## Open Thoughts

Currently, I do have two key considerations that occupy my thoughts. Firstly, the renewal of my J-FIND visa in July 2024 presents an unknown challenge, as no one has yet gone through this process. I'm uncertain about how things will unfold, but I plan to keep my network updated through my LinkedIn and Medium blog.

Secondly, I'm considering transitioning my J-FIND visa to a Business Manager Visa. This shift is driven by having more work at my sole-proprietorship with [aomelab.com](https://www.aomelab.com/), coupled with the development of a second business venture. Also, I would have to get another visa anyways after the end of the two year lifespan of the J-FIND visa. 

One crucial, yet pioneering support I received in this decision-making process was from the Tokyo One-Stop Business Establishment Center ([TOSBEC](https://www.startup-support.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/onestop/en/)). I was introduced to TOSBEC last year by [Anthony Griffin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonygriffin/), a seasoned business consultant and friend who has been my mentor over the last five years. With his profound understanding of establishing a business in Japan, from sole proprietorship to his registered business entity [SAGA CONSULTING](https://www.consultsaga.com/), Anthony guided me to TOSBEC. Engaging with TOSBEC was a novel challenge for both parties, requiring us to maintain regular communication to update and learn from each other.


## Closing Thoughts

Reflecting on obtaining the J-FIND visa, while I realize that it was an unforgettable experience, with my current knowledge I would advise others to consider simpler options like pursuing a student visa or securing employment first. I usually have a preference for the unconventional, yet this process involved numerous uncertainties, substantial time and financial investments, and immense effort. 

Though in one sense flexible, the J-FIND visa also proved to be quite limiting due to its unfamiliar nature in the immigration landscape. Consequently, I am now committed to advising those seeking the J-FIND visa, aiming to reduce their struggles and provide support wherever possible. 

Despite the hurdles, I wouldn't necessarily change my approach, as the novelty of the visa meant that initially, no one quite knew how to navigate it. And it is thanks to visionary leaders like [Paul McMahon](https://www.tokyodev.com/authors/paul-mcmahon) and supportive businesses like [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/) that journeys like mine receive the necessary attention and support, fostering a community of growth, innovation and change.</content>

    <content type="html">You’ve got the skills and the drive for the job, but how old are you again? Age matters. We all know it. The trick is knowing what you’re up against, why these obstacles persist, who might be able to help, and how far you may be required to shift your perspective from where it currently lies. 

To make sense of things, we called upon a willing set of lawyers, recruiters, education professionals, and one brave HR leader to get to the bottom of what is, for most, as rabbit hole of a topic here in Japan. We’ll cover the law, certain challenges specific to mid-career transitions, what recruiters and HR pros see out there in the wild, and if not working for someone else might be the best way to avoid age discrimination and bias altogether. First, cue the lawyers.

## Double Trouble: Japan’s Major Labor Laws, and making sense of what doesn’t make sense

[“There are no laws which specifically address age discrimination.”](http://www.agediscrimination.info/international-age-discrimination/japan)

We could *almost* stop here. 

Because, this terse statement from one of Japan’s “Big Four” law firms, Anderson Mōri &amp; Tomotsune, really *does* tell us everything we need to know. Being succinct, however, tends to prompt questions. 

To address some of those questions, we’ll be referring to two specific laws: the [Labor Standards Act (herinafter, the LSA)](https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3567/en), and The Act on Comprehensively Advancing Labor Measures, and Stabilizing the Employment of Workers, and Enriching Workers' Vocational Lives (hereinafter, the ”Employment Measures Act”), specifically, [Article 9](https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3957/en#je_ch1at9).

### Are Japan’s labor laws in conflict with one another?

If getting through the heft of any one single law weren’t enough of a challenge for intrepid legal sleuths, balancing the weight of two, understanding their interplay (and making sense of what is actually being said) is akin to a fool’s errand. Wishing to avoid such folly, we knocked on the door of Christopher Rathbone, adjunct professor at Temple University, Tokyo and foreign associate at [City-Yuwa Partners](https://www.city-yuwa.com/global/en/) for a bit of guidance. 

In helping us cut through decades of legal revisions and shifting nomenclature, Rathbone first had us zero in on two things: *general laws* and *special* laws. Within [Japan’s complicated hierarchical grab-bag of laws relating to labor](https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/search-cat), these distinctions help inform as to where to look when we sense a discrepancy. Here’s Rathbone: 

&gt; The LSA could be considered to have the status of a general law in Japan, meaning its provisions are intended to address employment matters *widely* [emphasis added]. Because general laws are broadly constructed, special laws later enacted are designed to address more specific topics. When discrepancies arise between the two, the special law will take precedence.

With the 1947 LSA acting as the *general* law, our *special* law (enacted in 1966) for the purpose of this argument, then, is the Employment Measures Act. Now, let’s get to understanding what these two laws actually say.

### What do Japanese labor laws *actually* say about age discrimination?

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"The Employment Measures Act pronounces the aims of the government, but only for the purposes of encouragement."&lt;/div&gt;

We learned at the outset the LSA doesn’t contain language related to age discrimination.

[Article 9](https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3957/en#:~:text=Article%209When%20it%20is,the%20provisions%20of%20Order%20of) of the Employment Measures Act (last updated as Act No. 102 of 2019), known by it’s rather lengthy “[popular name](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1766&amp;context=jeal):” *Ensuring Equal Opportunities Regardless of Age in Recruitment and Hiring,* however, *does* appear at face value to address this concern. But how accurate is that assessment? Article 9 says:

&gt; When it is found necessary, as prescribed by Order of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in order for workers to make effective use of their abilities, an employer must provide workers with equal opportunities in recruitment and hiring, regardless of their age, pursuant to the provisions of Order of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.

Rathbone: "Article 9 of the Employment Measures Act is designed to 'promote rather than punish.’ That is to say, the Employment Measures Act is intended to improve the labor market, particularly in avoiding labor shortages, by directing companies to hire the elderly and thus encourage the elderly to participate in the workforce.”

Here, it’s important to note Rathbone’s use of the word *elderly.* It’s intentional and reflective of the law’s intent because…, if—with near universality—elderly is defined as [65 and older](https://data.oecd.org/pop/elderly-population.htm), this law is designed with *that* population in mind. 

*Promote rather than punish* is additionally instructive. Again, Rathbone: “The Employment Measures Act pronounces the aims of the government, but only for the purposes of encouragement.” In layman’s terms, the non-coercive: “carrot, not a stick.” 

Michihiro Nishi, partner at [Clifford Chance](https://careers.cliffordchance.com/japan/home.html), explains further: “It is illegal to request new hires be of a certain age unless certain exceptions are met, under the Equal Measures Act. However, currently there are no criminal penalties for a breach of such obligations by employers; it is possible, though, that administrative actions may be taken (such as the issuance of a corrective order).”

The impact of such corrective orders, however, which run the gamut from removing a firm’s ability to place want ads with Hello Work, to simply “naming and shaming” offending businesses, as one might gather, can have limited affect. The larger and more familiar the name, the more significant the impact, of course, but for some firms, the public mention of misdeeds can in unique cases serve as a temporary [boon to business](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13331322) as was seen when some pachinko parlors chose to remain open during the coronavirus pandemic. 

### The vertiginous calliope ride of interpretive legal language

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"With great power comes great responsibility."&lt;/div&gt;

One of the most frequently cited miffs you’ll hear from recruiters operating within the Japan market is that they receive persistent requests from employers to source job candidates only within a certain age range. 

We wanted to understand the legitimacy of such requests through the lens of Japanese law, so we went back a second time to Clifford Chance’s Nishi via email for further clarity. Our question and his response are provided below in full.

&gt; [TokyoDev] People believe when an employer requests a candidate be within a certain age range (whether in writing, or verbally) that such a request is illegal, or against Japanese labor law. Can, in fact, such instances be considered "illegal" or "against Japanese labor law" given allowable exemptions under the 2007 amendment to the Employment Measures Act, and the fundamental absence of any law which addresses age discrimination?

&gt; [Michiro Nishi] There are no general, overarching or comprehensive statutes that address age discrimination. However, there are some statutes that address age discrimination in some specific situation/circumstances. At the hiring stage, the Employment Measures Act generally prohibits to request new hires be of a certain age unless certain exceptions are met. It is true that these exceptions are relatively wide. The answer to your question is, therefore, it depends. In light of the structure of the statutes, it is generally illegal or against Japanese law, but it is not illegal if any one of the exceptions are met. It is not always illegal, but it is not always legal either.

The idea that labor law appears duty bound to confound the average layperson, is not of course, unique to Japan; the law everywhere is difficult to parse. Here in Japan, phrasing such as "freedom to hire," "objectively reasonable grounds," and "appropriate in general societal terms," set the stage for an incredibly wide interpretive berth, and when paired with the “[six justifiable reasons for age limits](https://www.jil.go.jp/english/JLR/documents/2009/JLR22_all.pdf)” under the revision to the 2007 Equal Measures Act (p 61), the law can appear to mute even the softest attempt at promoting equal opportunity. It’s enough to weaken the resolve of even the staunchest supporters of equal opportunity when it comes to age.

This complexity, however, is—for legal scholars like Timothy Endicott, former first dean of the Oxford Faculty of law—precisely as it should be. He writes in [Vagueness in Law](https://academic.oup.com/book/10826), that “vagueness is a feature of law, and not merely of legal language: the linguistic and non-linguistic resources of the law are commonly vague,” arguing “the pursuit of justice and the rule of law do not depend on the idea that the requirements of the law are determinate in all cases. The resolution of unresolved disputes is an important and independent duty of judges—a duty that is itself an essential component of the ideal of the rule of law.”

But, for those of us not interested in situating ourselves in a courtroom, or pouring over legal texts and ruminating over the philosophy of law, how can we make sense of this juxtaposition between the law appearing to be in support of the *employee*, while at the same time appearing to wholly be in support of the *employer*? How can we level things out? Here, City-Yuwa Partners’ Rathbone makes things rather simple for us, and references the concept of noblesse oblige; retold, and known to all fans of Spiderman as: “[with great power comes great responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility).” 

When viewed positively (as is the connotation here), noblesse oblige speaks to the balancing act required when the possession of power and authority blends with the need to operate in the public sphere. Rathbone provides us with a glance as to how this plays out in the law. “The Japanese judiciary aims to protect the worker *primarily* [emphasis added]—not based on worker rights—but because the worker is the weaker party in the employment relationship and so needs protection; at the same time the judiciary maintains a deference towards the freedom of companies in making decisions.”

Indeed, says Nishi, “The basis of jurisprudence is the reconciliation of conflicting interests,” and “this is precisely the balance that must be struck between the free activity of business and the protection of workers.” He goes on to say that, “In order to have flexibility in the application of laws and regulations, it is inevitable to make the rules somewhat ambiguous by using broad concepts such as ‘reasonable grounds’ or ‘appropriate in general societal terms.’”

Which…, brings us back to square one and Anderson Mōri &amp; Tomotsune’s: “There are no laws which specifically address age discrimination.”

### A cramped opportunity to litigate

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt; “A certain number of the dismissal invalidation suits may in fact include age discrimination as one of the hidden issues…”&lt;/div&gt;

Bias and discrimination are notoriously difficult cases to litigate. Most tend to be less than [explicit](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2020-april/everyone-is-a-little-bit-biased/) (an important factor when it comes to the law), and the challenges prosecutors face can be daunting—even with the [most egregious of crimes](https://www.asiapacific.ca/publication/arson-korean-school-osaka-prompts-criticism-japans-hollow). As such, age discrimination cases infrequently make their way to the courts—particularly as they relate to hiring. 

“Pursuing discrimination in hiring has grounds in the Civil Code,” says City-Yuwa Partners’ Rathbone, “but even in the U.S., where age discrimination is expressly prohibited, establishing that discrimination has occurred is difficult.”

Ascertaining explicit bias aside, three additional reasons also create complexity: the judiciary’s focus on dismissal, the overall difficulty in litigating dismissal, and the lack of damages awarded. This trio of obstacles can prompt a more pragmatic course of action says Rathbone. “Arguing that letting someone go was not a valid dismissal (i.e., lacking objectively reasonable grounds and not appropriate in general societal terms) would carry more weight than specifically asserting age discrimination,” he suggests. 

Nishi echoes this sentiment. “A certain number of the dismissal invalidation suits may in fact include age discrimination as one of the hidden issues,” adding: “as a legal formality, such lawsuits may be in the form of contesting the abuse of the right to dismiss, etc.”

Suits related to hiring continue to be less prominent in part because as Rathbone puts it, “dismissals are highly restricted in any case (without invoking age discrimination), and there are no clear legal grounds for asserting age discrimination in hiring. As well, Japan has no discovery system, so proving discrimination in hiring is difficult unless the employers specifically mentions to the candidate age as a reason for refusing to hire.”

On damages, Clifford Chance’s Nishi says simply that “in Japan, the amount of damages awarded by the courts tends to be much lower than in the U.S. or other developed countries,” and “therefore, with the exception of lawsuits for invalidation of dismissal, there may indeed be fewer court cases based on age discrimination,” as a result. 

### Is change afoot? What the law of the future looks like in Japan

What should we expect as we edge toward tomorrow? For now, it appears as though we’re in for (mostly) more of the same. Rathbone sums up two related [changes coming April 1st, 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rules-clear-indication-working-conditions-change-from-rathbone-cfohc/?trackingId=3v2uoVHITEOGIXA5Kzgq0Q%3D%3D), namely: “Employers will have to give notice if they intend to limit renewals of fixed-term contracts at the time of conclusion of a fixed-term contract or when renewing a fixed-term contract. As well, employers will have to give notice that a fixed-term contract can be converted to an indefinite term contract after 5 years of renewals (currently the law, but not part of the notice of working conditions).” We asked Clifford Chance’s Nishi the same question. This was his response:

&gt; The Japanese government has been studying the systems of other countries and has been debating for years whether to create a law that directly prohibits age discrimination, but no legislation has been enacted so far, and I think this is unlikely to change at least in the next several years. With an aging society as a backdrop, incorporating the elderly into the workforce is an important social issue, and discriminatory treatment on the basis of age without reasonable grounds is likely to be subject to more stringent scrutiny going forward.

So, that’s the law. Up next, the things you wish you knew (or, perhaps… didn’t) when it comes to all that talk about you that goes on behind your back. Because being seen as “old” is not so far off from wherever you are in age at this very moment.

## What They Say When We’re Not in the Same Room

### How do employers in Japan handle age bias?

Ageism in Japan? As with anything, it depends on who you ask. We couldn’t poll all recruiters in Japan, but we were able to grab three of the best: Glen Brewster at [Exec-Search Partners](https://www.exec-searchpartners.com/), Jordan Jarjoura at [Meshd](https://meshd.com/), and David Sweet at [FocusCore](https://japan.focuscoregroup.com/). We asked each to help us understand obstacles candidates might face now, as well as those that are sure to pile up as one’s life-clock continues to tick. Which, ageism aside, is actually a pretty darn good thing.

### Dancing through culture

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt; “…though logical, thinking about age can put bias in the head.”&lt;/div&gt;

“Age has cultural complications in Japan,” says Jarjoura, reminding us quite adeptly of the obvious. *Dōki* (同期), he says is illustrative. *Dōki*, if you’re not familiar with the term, identifies two or more people who begin their time within a company in tandem. Let’s say, we have two d*ōki*; one is 40, the other 25. Outside Japan, this would be nothing to sweat. In Japan, however, such age disparity might cause some consternation. Not everywhere, but in enough places to matter. “Here, we have an expectation to treat someone older not as a peer, but as their *senpai,”* says Jarjoura, and “though logical, thinking about age can put bias in the head.” 

Sweet, whose firm FocusCore specializes in retained recruitment for foreign firms operating in Japan, sees the same thing. “Rarely do companies want a subordinate older than a manager,” he told us matter-of-factly. Some companies say they want someone ‘younger’ to help make the company a bit younger, so they can train someone up” he says, but “in reality, what’s implied is 1.) ‘we don’t want to pay much for this position, so let’s hire someone younger’ and 2.) ‘older people are stuck in their ways and more trouble.’” 

This sort of bias is, of course, [certainly not unique to Japan](https://www.who.int/news/item/18-03-2021-ageism-is-a-global-challenge-un); it may, however, be more up-front-and-center. Brewster tells us, “a candidate may be fully qualified—meeting to the letter the job requirements—but because of their age, rejected out of hand as a matter of balance for the team. There is a lot of quick glance rejection,” he says. 

Brewster’s take on this is intriguing—one might even say, warm. To him, “Japan wears its heart on its sleeve—they say what they want; younger recruiters don’t always like that.” It’s a position that, in land where the individual is widely believed to be overly reserved in opinion, may be worth pondering… might there be room for the appreciation of such candor? Personally, I find the idea ripe for honest debate. Bring it up next time at your favorite tachinomiya, why don’t you? It’ll no doubt make for an interesting and contentious evening out.

Provocation aside, no matter how valuable being candid may be, no one wants to have someone decide their fate without the ability to rise and defend oneself. And that’s perhaps the biggest issue. But, that’s life; it happens. And…, it will endure. 

“Most companies in Japan are still vocal about a preference around age. We may not want to talk about it in the open, but most are asking for candidates to fit into a certain mold,” says FocusCore’s Sweet. 

### Everyone is *absolutely* sizing you up

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt; "Of the seventeen we reached out to for this story, only five responded: two politely declined; three said yes."&lt;/div&gt;

Evaluations subtly based on age are quotidian, and [we all do it](https://hbr.org/2022/02/are-you-aware-of-your-biases). 

Behind closed doors, we talk about the type of employees we want to propel the firm forward or the young partner we see as being able to inject a bit of fresh air into staid processes; we fill job descriptions with implicit bias-ladened requirements [masked as job qualifications](https://www.discrimlaw.net/2022/08/30/code-words-that-might-indicate-age-discrimination/) in asking for tech-savvy employees, recent college grads, candidates with a certain tech stack, perhaps, simply, for an applicant in possession of “[up-to-date software knowledge.](https://www.hiration.com/blog/software-skills-in-resume/)” All of this could be suggestive of bias depending on who is paying attention. Truly, as the aforementioned Timothy Endicott suggests, an unfair amount of responsibility does rest with the judiciary. As it does with HR.

And so, while the uniquely wide look talent hunters outside a firm provide is informative, we also wanted to know what HR pros see on *their* side of the fence. How do human resource professionals contend with these issues? How do they get ahead of obstacles, encourage diversity, head off bias before it appears in new companies, or clear it out in established ones?

Of the seventeen HR leaders we reached out to for this story, only five responded: two politely declined; three said yes. Of those three, only one was able to meet our deadline—Sam Shah, HR Manager at [nanameue, Inc.](https://www.tokyodev.com/companies/nanameue) Before we get started, it’s important to note that given the sensitivity of the subject, Shah and his HR peers queried were asked to speak broadly about what they hear from peers in their universe—not with any specificity about what currently happens (or has ever happened) within the walls of their own firm. Enter, Shah.

“There are times when managers are vocal about age—usually it is to match with the current team personality as well as communication,” says Shah. “It is no secret ageism is very common in Japan, and while most just think hiring younger means cheaper—and, you can pull more work out of them—there can be valid reasons; mainly team communication and understanding of the product.”

FocusCore’s Sweet was able to shed some light on this as well given his close proximity to hiring managers and top leadership. “I’ve seen foreign companies come into Japan and they want YOUTH! They are going to have a CEO in their 30s and an energetic C-suite in their 30s. What these companies find is that these candidates don’t exist.” 

Sweet finds this drive for younger talent capable of doing everything imaginable shortsighted, and often short-lived. “Younger talent generally don’t have enough experience or ambition as their western counterparts to jump into a strategic level role,” he says, citing a Canadian firm adamant about hiring a 30-year-old CFO. They “waited for over eight months and ended up hiring someone in their 50s. The company soon pulled out of Japan.”

I asked Sweet and Shah if concern is ever expressed about the lack of space available for candidates over 50 to “grow into a role.” Shah feels such applicants “would have a hard time,” but that “it would very much depend on the industry.” Sweet, being on the agency side of things and afforded a bit more candor, says “Absolutely. In tech roles, it would be a fear for lack of relevant/updated technical skill,” he tells us. 

Growing into a role can be a real concern with firms, and you may be surprised by just how long that window can be. I ran into this myself when I had designs on pursuing a PhD in history at the still youthful age of 34. A beloved professor, talked me out of it; ageism in higher education wouldn’t do me any favors, he insisted—universities generally want faculty to improve upon scholarship, recruit new students and other big name scholars, and that given my “advanced age,” unless I wanted to toil as an underpaid adjunct for the rest of my life (if I could even *get* that sort of gig in the humanities) success was unlikely. He thought my skills would be better applied elsewhere. I listened. It was good advice.

## But, I’m still young.

If you consider yourself to be a “young” 40, or a young 50… even a young 60-year-old, I’m afraid the market doesn’t quite think of you that way. We’re in the same boat—at 54 now, it appears as though I’m far too ripe for anything beyond the discount bins at Daiei (they do have some nice carrots in there, though). 

In this storytelling section, however, I’m not talking about folks like us. I’m referring to those readers who are “young approved” according to the world of work—those vibrant souls still in their twenties who want to work in Japan, or who’re already here and deciding what to do with their future lives. Because make no mistake, GenZ, etc., you too should be contemplating the realities of your future now, not later. Because being *old,* as you’ll see, arrives long before you think it does.

### From 22 to 40 in a heartbeat: A cautionary tale

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"Life in your non-Japanese language bubble has caused your Japanese to suffer, but least you ‘get by.’"&lt;/div&gt;

Not in tech yet, but considering the jump? Consider one possible scenario simply for illustrative purposes: 

You arrive in Japan after college; let’s say you’re 22. Maybe you lived and breathed the Japanese language when young, and you’re already in the N2 camp. Nice work. You spend five years teaching your native language; not uncommon. After that five years of teaching, though, you want more. So, you think: Masters. You apply to a program, and enroll. You still need to eat, though, so you continue to teach part-time. You finish your graduate program in two years. Congratulations. You are now a robust 29 with seven years of teaching experience.

More minted than when you arrived, you continue to teach your native language, but now at a university. It’s rosy at first, but the money and students sleeping in class aren’t your favorite. There are other challenges. Your work is some distance from home, and your schedule is not the same as your significant other. Life in your non-Japanese language bubble has caused your Japanese language skills to suffer, but, at least you get by.

After three years teaching at university you’re now 30. You’ve had enough, and decide to transition to tech. Lots of opportunities there, you’ve heard, and lots of ways to learn. Your Japanese will still have to wait; now its time to beef up on programming languages. You wonder which niche to pick… *what, dear sage, does the future foretell?* Front end? Back end? Full stack? Who knows. You throw the dice. “I’ll have plenty of opportunities,” you tell yourself. 

You graduate at the top of your class, but your experience is thin. Good coding camps place graduates quickly, and [firms like Code Chrysalis offer lifetime career support](https://www.codechrysalis.io/en/career-support)—a huge plus. You land a job. With only a single year of coding experience, and now 32, you make do and buckle down. 

Five years later, you’re still in this first developer job of yours. You love it; being an independent contributor is where you see yourself remaining for the duration. However, you’ve got an itch: you’d like to try working for another firm as you feel you’ve hit a bit of a learning ceiling with this current company. The compounding experience deficit, though, has you worried; compared to fresh Japanese grads, who at this point [have more programming experience](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/2021/03/22/special-supplements/japans-giga-school-program-equips-students-digital-society/) than you, you’re a full ten years behind. What to do? At this point you are now 37. Should you jump ship? Having read an article on TokyoDev *way back when*, you’re well aware that as you near 40 things are going to be tougher than ever… time to think of “Plan B?”

Before we hit the panic button—as many voices will attest—transitioning to another firm *when you’re already in tech* is not impossible. We also don’t want you thinking that switching from another field to tech is impossible, as clearly is not. Both options, however, have distinct challenges as you age. 

As Jordan Jarjoura points out, “Age in Japan is used as a benchmark to allow for the assumption of one’s professional ability; graduation date and years of experience all play a part, and are still looked at as a factor in [leveling](https://lattice.com/library/what-is-job-leveling-and-how-does-it-work).” 

And, let me tell ya… these dates fly by like you would not believe. Research suggests most [make their way to Japan in their 30’s](https://www.statista.com/statistics/693035/immigrant-stock-of-japan-by-age/). I won’t posit as to what careers these new emigrants wish to pursue, or why they’re here. However, if these numbers are in any way accurate, my scenario above paints a somewhat rosier picture than what might actually be the case for most new arrivals. Add a family to the mix, and things get even dicier.

“Failing to plan is planning to fail,” an old boss used to tell me. I always hated that statement. But where he was right is that we can never plan for *what others have in mind for us.* So we’ve got to do our damnedest plan for *that*, and beat them at their own game. The lesson here is: don’t waffle, don’t wait. If you’re considering a future career in tech, bite the bullet and go—as quickly as you can. Because as you can see, the deck is stacked against you from the get go.

## Clearing Hurdles: The Mid-Career Transition

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"To some degree it’s a ‘sea change’ effort…"&lt;/div&gt;

So, let’s talk about this. Sam Shah feels switching industries can be accomplished up “until someone is in their 40's” but that “starting in your late 40s becomes a challenge.” It is possible to find jobs that are similar, he says, but that going for a career change “is a huge challenge.” 

David Sweet agrees: “I think it is very tough to switch industries in Japan.”  He tells of a cosmetics company client looking for a supply chain director role that was restricting their search only to candidates with experience in that industry. “Obviously, cosmetics has some critical importing criteria which makes this important, but eventually they opened their search to consider candidates from personal care, then finally, to all consumer goods companies, but that was as far as they would go. Even with positions like finance and HR, where you would think skills are transferable, many companies still favor those who come from industry.”

In the end, it comes down to the need to be open to “adjusting company culture.” says Jarjoura. “To some degree it’s a ‘sea change’ effort,” he says, but adoption appears on the rise—particularly “as Japanese companies become exposed more globally.”

Interestingly, nanameue, Inc.’s Shah sees opportunities for people with a strong network to transfer to “a new role as an advisor,” or perhaps “more on the blue collar side of things—something close enough, like in the way a system architect can flow into sales roles.” 

Jarjoura, whose team at Meshd helps high growth, new growth, and unskilled teams with a gamut of HR related needs, agrees: “with a few years of relevant experience, a Japanese firm might consider such a person worthy of hiring at a junior level, though skill based hiring can be seen from the outside as being relatively flat.” 

### Is there an age related cutoff point when it comes to finding new, gainful employment in Japan?

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"For those already working as developers, I reckon there is some flexibility, but that flexibility begins to decline once one graduates from their twenties into their thirties."&lt;/div&gt;

We wondered if there might be a set point where it becomes increasingly more difficult to find work—a time where ones category experience combined with an advance in age begins to place them out of favor as a mid-level hire—a time, when it just might be a wiser choice to stay put?

“Is there a cutoff point? It depends on the path you choose, says Bukky Adejobi, career coach at [Code Chrysalis](https://www.tokyodev.com/companies/code-chrysalis) in Tokyo. ”I would imagine the closer you are to 60, the more difficult it is to find employment when trying to break into an industry. For those already working as developers, I reckon there is some flexibility, but that flexibility begins to decline once one graduates from their twenties into their thirties.”

Adejobi cited placement results as one positive sign that being up there in age isn’t necessarily a career crusher, and tells us older developers who have completed their program were mostly in their mid- to late 40s, with one in their 50s, and that when we spoke in July of 2023, “among this group, less than 20% are still receiving support with their job-hunt,” with most of those grads being those who finished between the end of 2022 and May of 2023. Overall, “more than half of them have successfully found employment,” she says. 

Perhaps aware of Japan’s own drive to [redefine what is old, older, oldest](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/18/japan-doctors-propose-raising-retirement-age-to-75), Sweet relays the story of a German client who told him they had absolutely no preference with regard to age for a recent opening. “They have someone in their 70s working; this stopped me in my tracks as it was as rare as a hen’s tooth.” That said, for those of you eyeballing more of a country manager role, Sweet sees the door quite open. “Most companies would welcome someone in their 50s,” he says. Of course, not everyone wants to be a manager, let alone run the entire operation. What about the pleased as punch individual contributor, how do they fare?

### “I don’t want to be a manager.” A peek at individual contributors

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"It’s generally accepted in Japan, much more than in Europe or the U.S."&lt;/div&gt;

What if, after a decade plus of experience, you have little to no desire to enter the world of management? Can you remain as an individual contributor? Would this be a problem? Sweet has the single answer you’re looking for: “Nope.” Then adds, “It’s generally accepted in Japan, much more than in Europe or the U.S.” 

Shah, as well, says remaining an individual contributor as you age is far easier if you’re already within a company as opposed to coming in from the outside, so, “yes, and no. Of course, you have to show an understanding of the product,” he says, “but it definitely happens.” He even sees developers who shift into management and then back again—“sometimes they just love what they do.”

Adejobi concurs. “I don’t believe there are significant challenges in remaining an individual contributor,” adding: “experienced developers often seek opportunities in larger organizations to work on more substantial projects or join new companies as senior ICs. Age bias, when present, appears to affect individuals trying to enter the industry rather than experienced coders,” she says. 

### Is AI a threat to older candidates landing junior positions?

What about AI? If you’re considering a career switch and getting up there in age, is there any merit in the hullabaloo about AI threatening opportunities for junior roles? If AI is going to take away a swath of junior IT roles, wouldn’t someone already older with less potential room for a long career be at a true disadvantage in this situation? It depends on whom you ask. 

Shah says, he doesn’t see much threat at the moment. ”With AI coming in, I think there is still time before any “takeover” talks. Sweet, however, sees the threat as more pressing. “Absolutely” he says, and references his son, who is 25 and working as a game designer for a listed, Japanese game maker with 1,000+ employees. “He knows his days are limited.” 

Sweet’s son believes that “within 12-18 months, most of these positions will be gone in his company,” and Sweet thinks at “most companies, it will be first-in/first-out.”

## Not All Doom and Gloom; Embracing the Older Candidate

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"Digital technology changed everything…"&lt;/div&gt;

If you’ve exited your thirties, or soon will, your work life is certainly far from over. And, believe it or not, things do appear to be looking up—[even for Japan](https://www.jil.go.jp/english/jli/documents/2023/044-03.pdf); some outlets have even gone as far as to suggest mid-career shifts are “[booming](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Datawatch/Middle-aged-job-hopping-booms-in-Japan).” (For the time being, I’ll stick with “looking up.”) 

Glen Brewster, along with each of our interviewees, would likely welcome such news. He thinks Japan on the whole could benefit from adopting the Nissan model, where staff can rotate across divisions and regions, often providing them with opportunities [in global functions](https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/SUSTAINABILITY/LIBRARY/SR/2022/ASSETS/PDF/SR22_E_P140-144.pdf) (p 143) so they can experience the full “vision of the company,” as he put it. Designed with diversity in mind, such broad-scope programs at larger firms act as management pillars that, as Nissan’s corporate comms suggests, helps them build the strength of their team by reinforcing human resources “not only through the recruitment of new graduates but also by [actively hiring outstanding mid-career talent and mid-level management candidates](https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/SUSTAINABILITY/LIBRARY/SR/2023/ASSETS/PDF/ESGDB23_E_P102-106.pdf) from outside the company (p 105)." 

Jarjoura, who works with many firms of this size, sees some of this flexibility first-hand, and attributes much of the opening up of opportunities for mid-level hires to the changing digital landscape over the last two decades. “Digital technology changed everything,” he says. “LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter…  foreign firms already familiar with these methods leveraged them heavily to find and recruit talent, and Japanese companies had to compete.” Brewster, too, sees competitive strains influencing internal change.

“Companies are needing to see immediate results and poaching tomorrow’s talent to get there,” he says. “New grads lack the proper experience and training to sell well,” so “Japanese firms have decided to fight fire with fire and go against this intrusion by hiring innovative SEs (Sales Engineers) who already know how to sell creatively. They’re using every tool in their toolbox to compete.”

### Helping Japan balance its approach to a new tech workforce

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"…mindset change programs delivered as coding courses…"&lt;/div&gt;

Code Chrysalis’ Yan Fan is helping to bridge this gap between what companies think they need now, what they say as right around the corner, and how they identify cultural fit. Fan says Code Chrysalis devotes a large part of its business to providing enterprise training she says can be best described and “mindset change programs delivered as coding courses,” and realized early on that if they “wanted to make a real difference” in their community, they had to “engage with large Japanese corporations and help them in their efforts to nurture modern engineering and tech-enabled teams.”  

To date, their largest single class at a major manufacturing company has enrolled 200 students. “We hope that by educating more people, getting them more confident around coding and software and encouraging more diverse thinking, more business opportunities will be found and more jobs will be created.”

To ensure everyone gets a fair shot, Adejobi tells us Code Chrysalis pays a strict attention to potential partners, and recalls a situation where they passed on a partnership with a recruitment/sourcing company “to connect graduates with job opportunities” because of the presence of what they saw as hiring bias, “particularly with the majority of companies in their directory being classified as ‘traditional Japanese companies.’”

“Our primary requirement is that companies must not have any age or gender-specific criteria,” added Adejobi, “unless they aim to diversify their team with more female hires.” Thanks to this approach, she says they “don’t encounter many firms with age-based bias.” And, no doubt they’re righting companies along the way with this exertion of well-applied pressure. 

## The Thorny Question of Ethics: It’s Not Just Japanese Firms

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"This is all foreign firms…"&lt;/div&gt;

Lock-step recruiting, a preference for a pre-ordained career trajectory, and the perceived pursuit of cultural fit were all cited as reasoning for Japan’s difficulty in broadening its approach to HR. Things *are indeed* different here. So we wondered… if these practices are such an engrained aspect of Japanese business structure, how do foreign firms handle things? Is this propensity toward restrictive hiring practices mirrored in foreign firms operating in Japan as well? I asked David Sweet. “This is all foreign firms,” he said. Shah echoed the same sentiment: “Most definitely.” 

Adejobi says at Code Chrysalis, they have “learned about age-based hiring and compensation bias through feedback from graduates regarding their interview process and interactions with certain companies,” and says “these biases were observed in SMEs based in Japan, both foreign-owned and Japanese-owned, as well as large Japanese corporations with a bent toward more traditional operations, affecting candidates in their early 20s as well as those in their mid to late 40s.”

### My ethics or yours? Whose are best?

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"Most experienced businesspeople, Japanese and non-Japanese alike, would agree that doing business in Japan would be virtually impossible without adopting the practice."&lt;/div&gt;

This dismissal of employment parity present outside Japan in apparent favor of cultural relativism (the “when in Rome” approach) is worth examining more closely. Could it be that cultural fit in Japan is a more powerful construct? Or, are companies—free from the legal constraints of their own nations—simply taking advantage of an opportunity to hire young because in Japan they can get away with it? As with all of this, there is no simple answer; ethics and the law, while table mates, [do not always see eye to eye](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/esg/ethical-vs-legal-standards/). 

Cultural relativism, and its “inadequacies” have long been discussed by ethicists, as have its opposite, more absolutist approach, “ethical imperialism (the “our ethics are best” approach). How, then, can corporate HR departments, and individual hiring managers do the right thing? 

Ethical scholars such as Thomas Donaldson have suggested guidelines that can provide a “starting point for all companies as they [formulate and evaluate standards of ethical conduct at home and abroad](https://hbr.org/1996/09/values-in-tension-ethics-away-from-home), noting that “to be broadly relevant […],” they need to “include elements found in both Western and non-Western cultural and religious traditions.” […] and demonstrate a “respect for human dignity, respect for basic rights, and good citizenship.” Donaldson cites a relevant example related to gift giving in Japan: 

&gt; Managers should deem a practice permissible only if they can answer no to both of the following questions: Is it possible to conduct business successfully in the host country without undertaking the practice? And is the practice a violation of a core human value? Japanese gift giving is a perfect example of a conflict of cultural tradition. Most experienced businesspeople, Japanese and non-Japanese alike, would agree that doing business in Japan would be virtually impossible without adopting the practice. Does gift giving violate a core human value? I cannot identify one that it violates. As a result, gift giving may be permissible for foreign companies in Japan even if it conflicts with ethical attitudes at home.

If the goal of any firm operating in Japan is to attract, retain, and yes, profit from the capabilities of its workforce, one’s position on such matters is worth contemplating at length. After all, employees, like consumers, tend to vote with their feet, and the door swings both ways; miscalculations both literally and figuratively [can be severe](https://www.afslaw.com/perspectives/alerts/its-complicated-employers-who-ignore-the-interplay-between-us-export-control). 

By way of example, in an [eminently intriguing 1995 paper](https://digitalcommons.du.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1662&amp;context=djilp) from legal scholar, Kyoko Kamio Knapp entitled: *In the World, but Not of It: Japanese Companies Exploiting the U.S. Civil Rights Law,* Kamio Knapp details a dramatic rise in discrimination claims heaped upon Japanese firms operating in the U.S. at the time. The paper illustrates how devastating an ignorance (or avoidance) of the law can be to national reputations (not to mention corporate finances), and offers an illuminating look into both cultural relativism, *and* ethical imperialism at play—in near real time. It’s a paper certainly worthy of the curious reader’s attention. 

With near-make-believe tales of explicit bias that collectively resulted in Congressional intervention in 1991, Knapp’s paper prompts interesting deliberation, and forces a reckoning with how we as individuals come to decide whose ethics are “best” when the business practices of foreign and domestic employers don’t align. If you’re looking for a little light reading, you can read the [full 512-page Employment and Housing Subcommittee document](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000019271897&amp;seq=2), on which her assessment is based, along with other resources on the topics covered in this article. 

### A sidebar: The lure of contract workers

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"…as if the differences in employment regimes are like those between American and Canadian football…"&lt;/div&gt;

One thing that popped up in my discussion with Christopher Rathbone of City-Yuwa Partners was the increasing role contract employment plays around the world. For those foreign firms considering a more western-aligned approach to contract work (Uber, anyone?), I was curious if this sort of approach might rock the boat in unfamiliar and unwelcome ways here in Japan.

&gt; “If a foreign employer intends to hire workers for long term positions but seeks to try to have flexibility by employing the workers on fixed-term contracts, aside from the difficulty in actually dismissing the workers due to [yatoi-dome doctrine](https://www.jil.go.jp/english/jli/documents/2018/007-05.pdf), many well-qualified Japanese workers are put off by being on fixed-term contracts which they consider to be inherently inferior in status regardless of being offered overall better conditions by the foreign employer.”

As Rathbone suggests, there are obvious [social and financial complications specific to Japan](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18692729.2022.2028229), and he seems to consider the approach as needlessly restricting the talent pool. Globally, calls to reduce predatory hiring do appear to be [having an effect](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/09/ftc-crack-down-companies-taking-advantage-gig-workers); however, as we’ve recently seen in the UK, its a bit [too early to celebrate if you’re not a fan of the gig economy](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/21/blow-to-gig-economy-workers-after-uk-supreme-court-rules-against-collective-bargaining). 

Perhaps mindful of these situations (and the bottom line), Nissan, for one (and, perhaps not coincidentally), has taken the opposite approach—[bringing contractors in-house, and making them full time employees.](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/01/19/business/corporate-business/nissan-contract-workers/) Going against trend and increasing a firm’s commitment to talent is certainly one way to change the game. Speaking of sport, Rathbone has an illustrative story to share: 

“A big mistake made by foreign employers is thinking that employing workers in Japan will only require some tweaks of their global employment policy as if the differences in employment regimes are like those between American and Canadian football. Considering that employing workers in Japan will be a different sport entirely would be best because of the restrictions on dismissal or refusal to renew contracts in particular.”

## Maximizing Employability for the Long Haul

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"A clear and logical career progression is important…"&lt;/div&gt;

“It’s an open secret that it’s a candidates market,” says Exec-Search Partners’ Brewster, who thinks now is the perfect time for job hunting in Japan. But he stresses knowing how to make yourself appealing to hiring managers is critical.

“A clear and logical career progression is important,” and you’ll also want to be able to demonstrate that you’re still learning—and, not just tech skills. Employers will want to see “you’re becoming more skilled as time goes by,” he says, and they’ll be asking: “Do you have any certifications? How are your Japanese language skills? Have you graduated from one of Japan’s specialized schools, boot camps, or business schools?”

Essentially, he tells us, you need to be able to provide those with the ability to help you “a clear way to get you placed.” Knowing what it is you want, why you are the best choice for an employer, and going “all in with what you want to do” he asserts, is important.

How to arm yourself with the sort of confidence Brewster says you need to get ahead? Frequenting meetups ([Tokyo certainly has its fair share](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/tech-meetups-in-tokyo)), and commiserating with other tech professionals in places like our own [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/seUNe38YgV) server are two simple steps you could take that might help immensely. In our Discord server, for example, if you’re looking to find out what other candidates are experiencing in interviews and in and out of workplaces throughout Japan, we’d argue there is no better place. Don’t let schmoozing put you off. It often isn’t what you think. Just make an appearance; people *will* find you and make you feel comfortable.

“Your professional network and connections are powerful tools; make use of them.” says Adejobi. “Don't let the fear of how people perceive you hinder you from reaching out for help. The worst that can happen is someone could say no.”

## Seeing Yourself in the Wider Market: Fractional Hiring and Entrepreneurship

### Winding down (or, up!) with fractional employment

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"Once people are in late 50s finding a proper job starts to become harder…"&lt;/div&gt;

We touched on fractional employment in our March article about the expanding [Employer of Record ｍarket in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/employer-of-record), and were wondering if those we interviewed believe it to be on an upward swing in Japan.

Shah sees “growth” in the idea of fractional, and sees ”more and more older professionals moving to contract positions and such,” but David Sweet finds “it’s nothing like in the U.S.” and that he rarely sees it in the areas he works “except on some lower level accounting positions.” He posits, however, that it “depends on how transferable a person’s skills are and how flexible they are on their salary.” In general, he sees “people trying to make their last career move at 50, with people transferring to a different industry or position, much earlier at, maybe 40.” Shah seconds, this. “Once people are in late 50s finding a proper job starts to become harder,” he says. 

Exec-Search Partners’ Brewster commented on the fact that “most companies have internal retirement policy at 60-65, that can frequently allow an employee to either fully retire or semi-retire, or remain on signed as a contractor.” Such arrangements can “sometimes allow for a full salary, overtime, and bonuses,” he says, “but once you turn 65, there is social pressure to retire.” With natural lifespans in Japan running well past retirement age though, Glen says people do wonder: “how am I going to live with that amount of time left over?” 

“In traditional Japanese companies,” Sweet reminds us, “employees are generally promoted together. At a certain age, one person may be promoted over another and an early retirement will be offered. The employee then leaves the company, but will consult (sometimes in recruitment) for the company as a client. Many will try to start a company, find a company that will work with them, and also eventually hire them full time.” 

Shah brought this up as well, suggesting companies open to fractional hires may consider it as one way to “avoid middle men,” while allowing the employer to “hedge risk in case the person is not a match” were they to hire them outright.

Always good for an anecdote, Sweet says he has a friend in the U.S. creeping up on 60 this year who has aspirations to act as CFO at a different company but realizes the deck is stacked against him. He could work on contract for a smaller company at a fraction of the salary, he says, but “he’ll probably just stay on contract with the company until the company can hire someone to replace him.”

Which brings us to… hanging out your own flag. 

### Sailing your own ship as an entrepreneur

&lt;div class="embedded-text"&gt;"…in most cases, they’d seen our program as a means to gain the necessary skills to realize their entrepreneurial goals."&lt;/div&gt;

Starting your own business can aid in rendering this entire age question a non-issue—particularly if you’re the one doing all the hiring. 

A strong advocate for entrepreneurship, and a [business owner herself](https://awatori-shop.com/en/pages/her-story-by-awatori), Adejobi is big on encouraging students with excellent ideas when they possess the determination and mindset to see things through. When students do come to us with good ideas, she says, “in most cases, they’d seen our program as a means to gain the necessary skills to realize their entrepreneurial goals.”

Of course, starting a business is never easy, and as Sweet attests, “many may have good skills, but not the skill or desire to sell, market, network, or how to run cash flow.” Remaining in the workforce can also feel like a burden after a certain age, with the necessities of life causing many past age 60 to keep punching the clock just to [keep busy, maintain a clear mind, and pay the bills](https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h01646/)—frankly, the reasons we all pursue work to begin with.  

One-person consulting companies are a frequent choice among the recently retired (or let-go), though, something Sweet says has been the case in Japan “for many years, and often the only way for older professionals to work after they are on the job market later in life.” 

“I wouldn't recommend it to everyone,” says Adejobi, “but if you have a brilliant idea, I might suggest considering exploring it as a potential business venture.”

Why not, right?

## Bringing it all home

Let’s stay here, then, and end simply… with the optimism of Code Chrysalis’ Adejobi. 

She reiterates that “age can play a role in the job search, especially if your focus is on Japanese traditional corporations,” but that if you “shift your focus towards startups and networking, are not fixed on industries or particular roles, and are not overly concerned about salary, i.e., expecting a salary above the market average for new entries, you can find a way to succeed. There are always companies willing to give the right person a chance, but it will certainly not happen overnight.” 

Amen to companies giving everyone their fair shake.

## For more research:

### Japanese Law in a… nutshell?

Not exactly. But, this [guide to Japan’s legal system](https://www.daiichihoki.co.jp/store/upload/pdf/025965_pub.pdf), from [Business Law in Japan, Vol. 1](https://www.kinokuniya.co.jp/f/dsg-01-9784915845086) might give you a good head start.

### Interpreting the law in Japan

Understanding the law helps when you have good reference points written in relatively easy to understand language. In the United States, [the National Archives Code of Federal Regulations write-up on Title 29 is particularly helpful](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-B/chapter-XIV/part-1625) to get a feel for how other countries deal with age issues in the workplace; of particular note for those of us in Japan is the discussion surrounding workplace seniority systems.

Additionally, one of my main guides for background research was Hitotsubashi University professor of law, [Ryoko Sakuraba’s 2009 research](https://www.jil.go.jp/english/JLR/documents/2009/JLR22_sakuraba.pdf) on the Japanese labor law and its exemptions. While a bit dated, is exemplary in its detail and clarity. 

### “The carrot and not the stick” in practice: Approaches to the U.S. First Amendment

While a bit obtuse at first blush, “promote rather than punish” does have a place in the law, as we can see with this [U.S. Supreme Court judgment](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-804/184513/20210721135211418_20-804_Amici%20Brief%20in%20Support%20of%20Petitioner.pdf). While contextually different in that it references the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, it is at least linguistically linked. The main idea? "… the First Amendment aims to promote rather than punish counter-speech..." (p 11). 

### Learning about age discrimination laws in your home country

[Anderson Mōri &amp; Tomotsune’s, Age Immigration website](http://www.agediscrimination.info/international) offers analysis of age discrimination on 40+ countries. See how your home country fares. In every single one of them, vague language and exemptions rule the roost. 

### On ethics and culture

Federico Ast’s, *[The Moral Dilemmas of Global Business](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/60620)* is a particularly good read, as is an additional paper from Kyoko Kamio Knapp Knapp: https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/iiclr/pdf/vol6p545.pdf

### The complete congressional hearings covered in Knapp’s paper

For those interested in understanding the anti-Japan sentiment circulating in the U.S. and how this all played out in these 1991 Congressional Hearings, this paper is a treasure trove:

[Employment discrimination by Japanese-owned companies in the United States : hearings before the Employment and Housing Subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations, House of Representatives, One Hundred Second Congress, first session, July 23, August 8, and September 24, 1991.](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000019271897&amp;seq=2)

### Implicit bias. How will you fare?

We all use deeply rooted and often mysterious guidelines that help us evaluate people and situations each and every day—essentially, bias. Take [Harvard’s implicit bias test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) to see how you think of things. I’m not 100% sold on how the test works, but, then again, I’m not this kind of researcher. This test has been out there for a number of years now… 

### An argument against “at will” work through the lens of “unequal power”

Here’s a great paper from the Economic Policy Institute about an area of employment some (many?) find sacred. An opposing view: *[The legal ‘freedom of contract’ framework is flawed because it ignores the persistent absence of full employment](https://www.epi.org/unequalpower/publications/legal-freedom-of-contract-framework-is-flawed/)*

### Implicit bias and DEIB reading

Lehigh University psychology professor [Gordon B. Moskowitz’s books](https://moskowitz.socialpsychology.org/publications) are an excellent place to look for informed knowledge about bias, stereotyping and goal setting. 

### More papers on work in Japan

    <content type="html">As I talk about in my article on [creating a company in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/creating-company-japan), I initially ran TokyoDev as a sole proprietorship, but in late 2022 converted it to a company. This involved three steps:

1. Incorporate TokyoDev Inc, a Japanese Kabushiki Kaisha
2. Transfer the contracts with TokyoDev’s clients from myself to TokyoDev Inc
3. Transfer the intellectual property around the TokyoDev service from myself to TokyoDev Inc

The first step was pretty straightforward. As the TokyoDev service was doing pretty well financially at that point, it was an easy call to hire professionals to help, and I used [a judicial scrivener](https://shimax-legal.com/en/home-en/) to handle all the paperwork for the incorporation itself, and [an accountant](http://www.jbp-tax.jp) to handle tax related stuff. 

I had to do some research to understand how to approach the other two steps though, and so I thought I’d share the results in case it’s of use to someone else.


## Transferring Contracts From a Sole Proprietorship to a Company

Over the years, I have signed about 100 contracts between myself and different companies. These contracts had a success fee specified in them, meaning if someone got hired via TokyoDev, I’d be owed a fee. 

This arrangement meant I couldn’t easily just terminate my existing contracts as an individual, and re-sign as a company. If I did, I’d have to distinguish between hires made when I was running the service as an individual and as a company, and invoice differently. Not only would that create complexity process wise, I also thought it might raise some issues tax-wise.

So I consulted [a lawyer](http://tksb.jp/yoshizaki_takeshi/) about it. The lawyer pointed out that under Article 539-2 of Japanese Civil Law contracts can be transferred with consent of all parties:

&gt; If one of the parties to a contract made an agreement with a third party to transfer that party's contractual status to that third party, and the other party to the contract gives consent to the transfer, the contractual status is transferred to the third party.

To accomplish this, he drafted an Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). I then set about the arduous process of asking every active client to re-sign. They all did so, with only a few proposing minor changes, so I think the agreement was good enough.

For your reference, here’s [the agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xLsD_Y340YIZhaOnR-0UneYwHGbms-G3_0_71obkcSM/edit?usp=sharing). While it is fairly generic, there are some parts that are specific to my business, so you won’t be able to use it without some modification. But it should help you understand how you might do it.

## Transferring Intellectual Property From a Sole Proprietorship to a Company

I wanted to have a formal record of transferring the IP from me as an individual to the company. This was a just in case sort of thing, where some time later down the line, TokyoDev might be audited or go through a due diligence process, and I might not be around to attest that I had transferred it.

Because this was essentially an agreement between myself though, I thought it wasn’t worth the cost in getting a lawyer to draft something bespoke, so I found [an agreement](https://www.llcuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/Assignment-of-Digital-Assets-to-LLC.docx) that transfers the digital assets of an individual to a US LLC, and made some modifications to it myself. 

For consideration, I consulted the lawyer who drafted the MOU. He explained not having any consideration might make it be considered a gift, while assets like a name, website, and other digital assets are hard to evaluate monetarily. As such, he suggested setting it to 1 JPY, which I also confirmed with my accountant that was fine from a tax perspective.

With my changes in place, I asked the lawyer to review it for any major issues. He reported he didn’t find any.</content>

    </author>
    <content type="html">Over the last four years, I’ve been helping TokyoDev with UX, design, and frontend development. One project I’ve been working on is improving our branding. Today, I’m delighted to introduce the results of it: TokyoDev’s new logo.

![Our new logo](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE1NTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--8e16b523c41b0f03c6f73d485e6e49b59a701863/logo.png)

This new, fun and quirky, logo changes pretty much everything about our branding.

The logotype is 100% custom made and is not derived from an existing typeface. Bold and slanted, we intend it to represent the passion and dynamism that we have for what we do. 

The logomark is derived from an original character designed by our very own [Michelle Tan](https://www.tokyodev.com/authors/michelle-tan) representing a [celestial fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Fox_(mythology)). We wanted to add a friendly face to our site that could embody the TokyoDev spirit: agile, swift, playful and adaptable. 

In the coming years, our celestial fox will follow us around and we hope to bring its magical touch to our next projects.

In this article, I will try to tell you more about how we came up with this idea and our cooperative design process.

## TokyoDev’s branding challenge

Paul started TokyoDev as his personal blog in 2010, and so when it started, he was the brand. I first got involved in the project four years ago, after I got a message from Paul saying that he’d made a job board page on his blog, but the design was quite rough, and so he was looking for my help improving it.

What was then "just" a blog needed to become a little bigger than that, and so I came up with a new design that would put the job board front and center.

When we first tackled that redesign, we thought of it as utilitarian. We wanted to make it fast, compact, and accessible. In other words, we wanted to vanish behind the "tool", and TokyoDev as a brand was not an urgent preoccupation for us. A clear sign of that was that we never made a proper logo for it. Rather, we slapped two curly brackets around the site's title and called it a day. It was mostly fine to us. 

As the site grew though, our lack of branding presented us with several challenges.

First, TokyoDev was moving beyond just being a job board. We’d created our Discord community, we were hosting events online and offline, sponsoring diverse communities in Japan, and commissioning outside contributors to share their knowledge of working in Japan. Not having a cohesive brand made it harder for us to tie all these pieces together.

Second, since we launched the TokyoDev job board, a competitor with a very similar name to us emerged, which led to us being confused for them and vice versa. Not an ideal situation for either of our businesses, and so we wanted to better be able to distinguish ourselves.

Third, TokyoDev as a name didn't fully represent what we were doing. As a site, we wanted to support international developers all across Japan, not just those in Tokyo. Changing names came up as an option but we ultimately decided to stay as TokyoDev.

Finally, we felt that our utilitarian, text-heavy approach was a mismatch with our team personality.

## What we wanted the TokyoDev branding to convey

Branding could only help us better convey who we already were. But we wanted to be intentional about what aspects of ourselves we were going to emphasize. So we sat and tried to define who we are as a company, what we do, what our objectives are.

* We are developers working for developers
* We help developers who want to work in Japan
* We want to support the developer community in Japan
* We are approachable, honest and friendly

## Renaming the site

Some of our branding challenges could have been solved by renaming the site to something else. While we considered this, we also quickly abandoned the idea. 

While the name wasn’t ideal from some perspectives, it was good in others. Maybe it missed out on some nuance, but it was short, and quickly conveyed to developers that it was a place for them. We’d also already built up a large audience in the decade plus the site had been around, and there was also a great deal of sentimentality around it.

So we decided to leave the name as is, and instead see if we could tackle our branding challenges in another way.


## Introducing a mascot

The next approach we tried was coming up with a mascot. Not only was imaging a character fun, but we thought it could bring a number of advantages.

* A character would allow us to make custom illustrations for the site depicting real life situations 
* We could maybe give it a name and customize it for different occasions
* It would also help naturally show TokyoDev as a group of human beings working on helping others achieve their goals

That last one was particularly important to me because to be quite honest, I'm not very fond of how cold and dehumanized job marketplaces can be. Even in a sector as dynamic as ours, looking for a job isn't always a good time.

We started brainstorming asynchronously on Slack about what kind of character we imagined working for TokyoDev. Possibilities were almost endless but we quickly decided that whatever character we chose should have a special link with Japan. For example, a TokyoDev Kappa Rubber Ducky was discussed early on! We were all interested in a legendary or mythical creature but with all sorts of quirky tweaks.

![A potential kappa mascot](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE1NTUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4df7d619fceb4bd4b6c6aa8eb53da3b54eb1fc63/kappa.png)


This is where Michelle Tan, a developer working with us, really had a chance to shine. Unlike Paul and myself, she is really good at drawing! She helped us not only with ideation, but also with coming up with characters themselves. 

We ended up reaching a consensus on a celestial fox-type character. We thought that in addition to being cute, the qualities generally associated with foxes, such as intelligence, agility, and adaptability, were a good match with ourselves and our audience. 

Michelle worked on creating this character from the ground up. 

![Sketches for our character](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE1NTYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--c25c5de6c482712fd144b733c02c85e53c092b89/mockup.png)


As you can see, early versions of our fox looked already pretty close to our final logo. We thought it was super cute and were eager to see it develop on stickers. Michelle immediately started working on collaborative stickers with some community events we attended.

![Stickers of our fox](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE1NjMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--1a6eaf31da05342102de6ed47d7d7595a48fd534/out.png)

## From mascot to logo

While the character worked great as a mascot, I felt it had too many details to work well as a logo mark. So we tried simplifying and trimming details, but as we removed them, the design became more ambiguous, something that could have been a fox or a dog or a cat or even a pokemon.

We had hit a wall. It was clear to me we lacked the experience to turn an original character creation into a professional logo. I was really proud of how far we’d come on our own, but it was time to admit we could use some help. So we turned to [a professional](https://www.instagram.com/tatsushi_eto/) to take our idea across the finish line.

We're delighted that our new mascot and logo reflect the essence of who we are and where we see ourselves heading. We're looking forward to seeing where this little fox will lead us and hope you'll enjoy and welcome it just as much as we do.</content>

    <content type="html">I’m a 23 year old software engineer with four years of experience, and have been  working in Poland for the last two years. Half a year ago I visited Japan where I really fell in love with the people, culture, and food; it felt like a different planet. After I returned to Poland, I thought it would be nice to try to relocate to Japan, just to try it out and learn the language.

I started to look into how I can find a job that offered relocation and didn’t require Japanese language ability, searching through LinkedIn, TokyoDev, and many similar sites. I applied to pretty much every company I thought would be a nice fit, but no one replied to me. That might be because I do not hold a bachelor's degree, and recruiters often ignore resumes from abroad if they don’t have a bachelor or better degree because it’s not obvious if I would be able to obtain a work visa.

So I planned to enroll in a Polish university to get my bachelor's degree. During that time, I would study Japanese, so I would be ready to relocate. I figured it would take me three or four years.

But then one of my friends sent me a link to the [Polish-Japanese Tech Job Fair &amp; Forum](https://challengerocket.com/polish-japanese-job-fair-forum) held in Krakow. It was a forum where Japanese companies like Fujitsu, Yokogawa, and JTP Co would present what they are doing, looking for freshly graduated engineers who would be interested in working for them, potentially even relocating to Japan (some companies had offices in Europe, so both options were available).

At the forum they were going to hold a coding contest, with the 1st place prize being free flight tickets to Japan. I thought it might be a very interesting opportunity so I jumped on the train and went to Krakow. The forum was interesting, and I was able to talk with every company representative. Some were looking just for engineers, while others were looking just for freshly graduated students because they couldn’t offer a high salary.

This forum happens once a year and is held in a few countries across Europe. This time it was held in Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria, with the same companies attending. In each country, they held this coding contest, so three people won a free ticket to Tokyo. Since the contest was held at the end of the event, many company representatives were interested in who was going to win it., 

The contest itself was organized by Challenge Rocket, a platform similar to leetcode, but focused on hiring engineers for companies. It was a medium difficulty algorithms and data structures problem with a 10 minute time limit. I won it by coming up with a solution that passed nine of the ten test cases faster than the other participants. The organizers called me on stage and congratulated me. After that, company representatives started to approach me and exchange contacts. The companies which I liked agreed that I’d schedule an on-site interview or meeting with them while I was in Tokyo, so I could see if there was any open position for me.

Fast forward to two months later when I arrived in Tokyo, I already had six appointments scheduled with different companies and METI. I really expected that every company would be interested in hiring me or at least discussing any work opportunities, but after attending the meetings, they were mostly interested in just presenting their company, telling what they do and wishing me a pleasant stay. I wasn’t talking with technical people, nor HR or recruitment, just managers. I only had 1 proper interview (behavioral and technical on separate days) out of all six appointments I had.

The company I interviewed with was not very international. I passed both rounds of interviews and we started to discuss the salary, when I will be able to start work, my visa situation, and things like that. But their base salary, even for middle/senior positions, was really low – around 3.5 million yen. This was really surprising to me, and I personally was not ready to take such a big pay cut to move  to another country. 

With it being my second visit in the last seven months, the burden of traveling between Europe and Japan also weighed on me. I started to think that even though I liked Japan, it wasn’t my dream country. That meant the downsides like it being very inconvenient to travel anywhere else, and all my friends are living in the EU timezone, made it not worth relocating Maybe for a year or two on a high paying contract I’d do it, but I think that’s only possible if you are a very qualified engineer or manage to get hired by an international company.

Every other appointment I had, managers just asked me questions like how do I like Japan, what I’m doing on my job, and taking pictures of me. I guess just to finalize the whole forum thing, and show that they met me and talked with me.

To wrap things up - Japan is a good country if you are willing to sacrifice your flexibility in frequently traveling internationally because it gets very pricey, long, and inconvenient. If that's not a problem for you, I think Japan can offer a lot in exchange, especially if you are able to land a job in an international company. I plan to visit Japan occasionally, but my goal of finding a job and relocating there is no longer relevant. 

For people who are living in Europe, I think forums like this are a really great opportunity to at least see what companies can offer, and they are really open to talk with anyone who attended since it’s the main reason why they are participating. From what I know, due to limited budget, next year they do not plan to hold the forum. But the year after I think they will hold it again. It’s usually held during the autumn season, so follow [METI's LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ministry-of-economy-trade-and-industry/), and some other companies which are organizing the whole thing so you won't miss it. 

If you do win the coding contest, chances are really high that you’ll get at least one company interested in you and helping you to relocate to Japan. 

Overall, it was a great experience. Even though I didn’t end up relocating because of it, it did help me understand that perhaps the country wasn’t for me, and ended up saving a great amount of time compared to my original plan of completing a degree and studying Japanese for several years.

    <title>TokyoDev 2023 Recap</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/tokyodev-2023-recap"/>

    <content type="html">2023 was an interesting year. While the tech market crashed in the US, I’d decided to expand TokyoDev, growing it beyond myself, and reinvesting the success we’ve had so far to expand the business further than I could on my own. As I heard about wave after wave of layoffs, it had me wondering whether that was the right call.

Fortunately, it seems to have been. Though Japan’s market for hiring international engineers wasn’t as frothy as it had been the previous couple of years, new international developers could also get into the country, which seems to have balanced things out.

From a revenue perspective, 2023’s was slightly up compared to the previous year. But beyond that, we’ve had a ton of other successes that I’d like to highlight in this recap.

## 71 developers got a job via TokyoDev

In 2023, we tracked 71 developers that were successfully hired after applying for a position on TokyoDev. This was only up slightly from last year’s 69 developers. When we’re used to talking about numbers in “internet scale”, this may not seem like a lot. But for many of these people, it was their first job in Japan, and I’m proud to have helped them set their life in a new direction.

## 41 articles were written by 14 authors

One of the biggest changes we made in 2023 was having outside contributors write articles for the site. In 2022, I was the sole author of the articles on the site, and wrote three of them. This year, we had 40 articles contributed by 14 different authors!

The most popular article by page views was my most recent one, [Unbricking my MacBook took an email to Tim Cook](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/unbricking-my-macbook-took-an-email-to-tim-cook). Not exactly relevant to the core mission of the site, but the wide appeal of it helped it go viral.

The top five articles by page views from other contributors were

1. [Working as an Indonesian Software Engineer in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/working-as-an-indonesian-software-engineer-in-japan) by Anzhari Purnomo
2. [How I Obtained a Business Manager Visa in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/obtaining-a-business-manager-visa-in-japan) by Bryn Dyment
3. [Working as a Filipino Software Developer in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/filipino-software-developers-in-japan) by Mary Grygjeanne Grace Icay
4. [Paternity Leave in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/paternity-leave-in-japan) by Keiko Kimoto
5. [How to Write Resumes for Jobs in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/how-to-write-resumes-for-jobs-in-japan) by Scott Rothrock


## 713 developers answered our survey

Since 2019, TokyoDev has conducted an annual survey of international software developers living in Japan. [The 2023 edition](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US) was the biggest yet, with 713 developers telling us about things like salary, working conditions, and the technology they used.

This survey also saw us move from a simple Google form and some custom charts, to a more dynamic and customizable solution we were able to offer by partnering with [Devographics](https://www.devographics.com).


## 2,000+ people joined our Discord

In 2023, over 2,000 people joined TokyoDev’s Discord, bringing our total member count to 3,949. It’s been especially rewarding for me to see all the support the community has provided for each other. I’ve also enjoyed watching people join the server from abroad to ask questions about getting a job in Japan, to them actually landing one and making it to the country.


## 1,244 commits were made to our main branches

Technology wise, I’d been keeping TokyoDev as simple as possible. [All code is technical debt](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/all-code-is-technical-debt) after all. Historically, the site has been a completely static one, generated via [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com). 

However, in late 2022, I decided to finally add our first dynamic component: an application form for jobs that we’d use when companies didn’t have a good solution to track applications themselves. I delegated this task to contractors, and commissioned a custom Ruby on Rails app (my tech stack of choice). The main job board, articles, and everything else stayed in the same static site.

With 2023, I decided it was time to pull the trigger and migrate everything to the Ruby on Rails app, and we spent the first half of the year doing this. It laid the foundation for other dynamic components, like our recently added custom filtering of jobs, and should serve us well going forward.

In a similar vein, we swapped out our custom CSS for Tailwind. That allowed us to easily add a dark mode to the site, and should speed up future frontend development.


## 10 events were hosted by us

2023 saw us hold our first in person events, centered around the burgeoning Discord community. We hosted a total of five in person meetups, including a barbeque catered by our community moderator, Scott. We also experimented with online events, having two “office hour” style events where community members could ask questions, and three interview-style events where I spoke with another developer about their life in Japan.


## 5 new contractors joined us

I’m still the only full time employee of TokyoDev, but we added 5 new part-time contractors, bringing our total to 8 people with ongoing contracts with us.


## 8 organizations were sponsored by us

In late 2022, we looked at [supporting communities that empower women in technology](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/supporting-communities-women-technology). In addition to sponsoring those 5 communities for 2023, we also sponsored [Women Developers Summit 2023](https://event.shoeisha.jp/devsumi/20231107), [JSConf JP](https://jsconf.jp/2023/), and [CreativeTokyo](https://creativetokyo.com). As the site originally [got its start](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/the-story-of-tokyodev) from me attending developer events in Japan and blogging about them, it was nice to be able to close the circle by sponsoring them.

In 2024, we’ll be looking to expand this, and so if you're organizing a community or event that is broadly related to our mission of helping international software developers start or grow their career in Japan, please do get in touch. I’d really love to see how I could help, and the barrier for us to sponsor something is pretty low. For several of the organizations we sponsored this year, we were their first sponsor ever.


## Closing thoughts

2023 was to be the year I expanded TokyoDev beyond myself. Looking back over all we’ve accomplished, I think I was successful at that goal. We’ve brought on new team members and contributors, partnered with and sponsored other organizations, and grown a community around the site. It feels like we’ve built a lot of momentum over the last year, and I’m looking forward to seeing what the next holds.

    <title>All About Working Visas for Hiring Foreigners Full-time in Japan</title>

    <author>
      <name>Takumi Nakamura</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">*This article is a translation of [a Japanese article](https://michi.sociarise.co.jp/recruiting-tips/working-visas/) by Takumi Nakamura, the CEO of [Sociarise](https://sociarise.co.jp), a consultancy for hiring global talents.*

When considering hiring foreign nationals, their status of residence matters heavily.
In this article, we cover the “working visa” that foreign employees must obtain to be employed full-time in Japan.

## There is no such thing as a “working visa”?

First, I’m going to tell you a shocking fact: what we call a working visa is not actually a visa. This may sound nonsensical, but in Japan there are two systems, visas and statuses of residence, and the common name “working visa” is often used to refer to a status of residence that entitles the resident to work in the country.

The differences between visa and status of residence are as follows.

### Visa

Handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A visa is a recommendation letter from the head of the Japanese embassy or consulate-general, which states that the person has been judged and considered suitable to enter and stay in Japan, and asks immigration to undertake an inspection of the person.

### Status of residence

Handled by the Ministry of Justice. Status of residence is a system that permits a person to stay in Japan for a certain period of time and to engage in a specific activity, status or position.

These two are often used interchangeably, but remembering the differences could help prevent unexpected mistakes. In this article, we’re using the common name “working visa”, since we titled this article using the term.

## The most common five types of working visa

There are many different types of working visa, which allow foreigners to be employed full-time in Japan. It’s difficult to cover them all, so here I’ll explain five most common types of working visa.

* Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services visa (Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services status of residence, 技術・人文知識・国際業務)
* Highly Specialized Foreigner visa (Highly Skilled Professional status of residence, 高度専門職)
- N1 visa - Designated Activities (No. 46 status of residence, 特定活動46号告示)
- Special Skilled Worker visa - (Specified Skilled worker status of residence, 特定技能)
- Intra-company Transferee visa - (Intra-Company Transferee status of residence, 企業内転勤)

## Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services visa (Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services status of residence)

Most foreign office workers in Japanese companies are said to have the Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services visa, commonly referred to in Japanese as the “Gi-Jin-Koku” (技・人・国) visa. We’ll explain this type of visa first.

The Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services visa is a status of residence for foreigners who want to work using their skills and knowledge that they acquired at universities, professional training colleges, etc. There is widespread misunderstanding of this visa, with approximately 15% to 20% of foreign students who apply for switching their visas have been rejected in recent years. It is regarded as a “hard-to-get” visa.

In reality though, it’s not that difficult to get accepted. In fact, the Immigration Office provides plenty of guidelines that tell the cases they reject or accept, so if you read them carefully, there’s a very good chance that the application will be accepted. I have seen more than 300 applications in the past, but only a few of them have been rejected. When it comes to university and graduate school graduates, I’ve never seen anyone rejected.

There are two main reasons when applications get rejected. One is when the applicant clearly does not meet the requirements for the Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Service visa. For example, the job they’d be engaged in only includes simple tasks that anyone could do (such as simply packing goods into boxes or placing parts on a production line), the salary is cheaper than Japanese employees doing the same jobs, or the company has the person do work that is completely unrelated to what they learned at school or their past work experience. In this case, no matter how hard they try, they’d never be able to get the application accepted, so it’d be better trying to get another type of working visa.

Another reason is that submitted documentation is insufficient. This is a pitfall when applying for a working visa, but there are things that should be submitted even if they are not clearly described on the Immigration Bureau's website. Conversely, if you submit more documentation than you are required, it could also increase the possibility of rejection. What is sufficient and appropriate can only be gathered from past experience of application procedures, and it may also change due to social situations and other factors. Therefore, the right level of documentation is something that can only be accurately predicted by those who regularly undertake these procedures. Submitting inappropriate documentation is probably the reason for most of the companies that have been rejected.

### Characteristics of the Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services visa 

There are some exceptions, but basically, this visa is granted if the educational background or professional experience requirements are met. The education requirement is that the applicant must have graduated from a university (including junior college) or graduate school with a degree. Additionally, those who have graduated from a Japanese vocational school (専門学校) and hold a title of “Specialist” (専門士) meet the requirement. 

Universities and graduate schools the applicant graduated from can be located overseas, but professional training colleges are in principle only ones in Japan. However, depending on the hours of study and the content of the course, the school could be treated as a junior college (短期大学) or a higher technical college (高等専門学校) instead of a vocational school, so you need to check individually if the applicant’s educational background is equivalent to what’s required. In my experience, an Associate Degree has a high chance of being accepted, while a Diploma or Certificate has a high chance of being rejected.

As for the alternative work experience requirement, the applicant is required to have at least 10 years work experience in the job the person is going to be engaged in. The requirement is described as “work experience”, but it could also include the period that the applicant learned and acquired relevant knowledge and skills at a university or technical college. 

For instance, if an applicant you are looking to hire as a programmer has studied information and communications for four years at university and two years at graduate school, then those six years are considered to be part of the required 10 years experience. So in this case, four years of actual work experience is sufficient. Note however, in this case, since the education requirement is already fulfilled with the university degree, there’s no need to apply with the work experience requirement in the first place.

Another example is “work that requires perspectives or sensitivity based on foreign cultures" such as translation, interpretation, language instruction, public relations, advertising or international trades, fashion or interior design, or product development. For these jobs, three years of work experience is sufficient to meet the work experience requirement. Furthermore, for positions related to translation, interpretation and language instruction, if the applicant is a university graduate or above, the educational background or work experience requirements are mostly disregarded. This explains why the number of permits for "interpreter/translator" jobs are overwhelmingly high.

The periods of residence under the Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services status can be valid for three months, one year, three years or five years, depending on the applicant's situation. This visa is renewable.

### Things to note about the Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services visa

Even if the applicant meets the educational requirements, the level of difficulty to get this visa depends on where the person graduated from. Specifically, if the person has graduated from a university or higher, or from a vocational school. Both have the same criteria such as a connection between what you have studied as a student, and what you are being hired for. But there is a big difference between university and vocational school graduates in terms of how this is judged. I won't go into the details, but in general, university degree holders are considered to have knowledge in wider fields that could be applied in their work, while those with a title of Specialist are considered to have expertise in a limited area and are good only in that area. So, obviously people with a title of Specialist are expected to relate their educational background to their work more strictly than those with a university or higher degree.

For instance, a graduate in economics from a Japanese university is more likely to be permitted to work in fields like accounting, marketing, planning, sales, and trade administration. On the other hand, if a person who studied “accounting and bookkeeping” at a Japanese vocational school is basically only permitted to work for accounting positions.

## Highly Specialized Foreigner visa (Highly Skilled Professional status of residence)

The Highly Specialized Foreigner visa is a working visa for “high-level talent”, such as people who can fulfill the positions that require a particularly high level of technical skills or expertise. Because such people are extremely valuable to the Japanese economy and society, they are accorded much advantageous treatment. 

The first thing to understand about this Highly Specialized Foreigner visa is that it is based on a point system. An applicant will only receive this visa if they earned a certain number of points. 

### About the point system

This Highly Specialized Foreigner point system certifies the applicant as a highly specialized foreigner if their total points are above the reference points (currently above 70 points), basing the points on factors such as education, work experience, annual compensation, age, bonus, and others.

See the list below. If the points of the foreigner you are looking to hire has above 70 points, the points are sufficient.

### What are “Type 1 Highly-Skilled Professional” and “Type 2 Highly-Skilled Professional”?

The status of residence for highly skilled personnel is divided into Type 1 and Type 2. They are not divided by field or industry, but those who have worked for more than three years after having received Type 1 Highly-Skilled Professional could then be eligible for Type 2 status. You can say the Type 2 Highly-Skilled Professional status is an extension of the Type 1 Highly-Skilled Professional status.

The Type 1 Highly-Skilled Professional is valid for five years. Once it’s transferred to Type 2, the holder is eligible for a permanent residency. Also, they can be eligible for a permanent residency only after one year if they have more than 80 points. Note that this permanent residency is not granted automatically, so the holder needs to apply for it.

The Highly-Skilled Professional visa principally allows (i) advanced academic research activities, (ii) advanced specialized/technical activities and (iii) advanced business/management activities.

1. Advanced academic research activities are defined as "activities of research, research guidance or education based on a contract with public or private organizations in Japan", such as university professors.
1. Advanced specialized/technical activities are defined as "activities that require knowledge or skills in the natural sciences or humanities based on a contract with public or private organizations in Japan", which is similar to Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services.
1. Advanced business/management activities are defined as “activities of business management or administration in public or private institutions in Japan”, such as company owners and managers.

As mentioned above, this Highly Specialized Foreigner visa offers various kinds of preferential treatment. That includes allowing multiple residence activities, the employment of a spouse, accompanying parents or domestic servant under certain conditions, and prioritizing immigration and residence procedures. At the moment, the benefits are only for the individual foreigner, so it might be important to give incentives to companies in order to increase the number of foreign people acquiring this visa.

### N1 visa (Designated Activities No. 46 status of residence)

The N1 visa is commonly called so because one of the requirements for this visa is the Japanese Language Proficiency Test N1, but originally it is “Notification No. 46” of the Designated Activities status of residence. 

In short, “Designated Activities” means "all the other activities". It is hard work to legislate all the residence statuses, as society is changing so fast that the legislation system often fails to keep up. In such cases, the Minister of Justice is given the authority to give permissions tentatively. This is the Notified Permit for Designated Activities. 

No.46 is a new system that was put into effect in 2019, and introduced in response to the growing demand for inbound tourism. It allows full-time work in previously unauthorized occupations such as customer service in restaurants, retail sales and taxi drivers. While there was a high demand for these types of jobs, they were outside the scope of the “Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services”, “Highly Skilled Professional”, and “Technical Intern Training” (技能実習) systems, so there could have been an urgent need to establish a corresponding status of residence.

This is just personal speculation, but I think this could be a trial operation to create new residence status such as a  “Japanese language visa” or a “Japanese knowledge visa” in the future.  Since the declining birth rate and aging population are becoming serious issues in Japan, there will surely be a labor shortage in all industries. Due to this, it would be useful to have an all-purpose visa that could be used for any type of job. If Japan restricts visa issuance to people with a higher level of educational or professional background, it’d be difficult to secure enough people. 

Additionally, the Technical Intern Training system has been criticized internationally. Being able to issue a visa simply when the applicant is proficient in Japanese would make it possible to secure a certain number of people as workforce who are likely to fit in well with Japanese society.  The risk of them being forced into inhumane circumstances is also much lower since they are fluent Japanese speakers. It could be a good status of residence that could be used in parallel with the new status of residence “Specified skilled workers” (特定技能).

The N1 visa can be valid for six months, one year, three years or five years, depending on the applicant's situation. This visa is renewable.

### Characteristics of the N1 visa

N1 visa requires the following six requirements.

#### 1. Must be employed full-time

Full-time employment as a regular employee or contractor is required. Part-time employment is not permitted.

#### 2. Must have graduated from a Japanese university or graduate school with a degree

Even if it is a Japanese educational institution, a diploma from a Japanese language school, vocational school or junior college is not sufficient. Also, diplomas from overseas universities or graduate schools are not accepted.

#### 3. Must have JLPT N1, or 480 or above on the Business Japanese Proficiency Test

However, those who have graduated from a university or graduate school in Japan or abroad with a major in Japanese language are exempted.

#### 4. Must have equal to or higher compensation than Japanese nationals

The compensation and employment conditions must be the same or better than those of Japanese university or graduate school graduates.

#### 5. The work must require smooth communication in Japanese

This includes works that require some sort of 'interpretation/translation', such as connecting foreign customers or employees to Japanese, or work that requires using Japanese language.

#### 6. The work must require what they learned in university or graduate school

The job is expected to include work that requires what the applicants learned in university or graduate school. The relevance of the acquired knowledge and the work is not considered so strictly, so the applicant could be engaged in a wide range of works/industries. This is the difference from Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services that I explained earlier in this article.

### Examples of jobs that can be engaged with Designated Activities. No.46

Example jobs that may be accepted include

- Providing customer service in restaurants that includes interpretation for foreign customers
- Acting as a guide or providing customer service in accommodation facilities that also includes interpretation for foreign guests
- Communicating and passing instructions from Japanese employees to foreign employees who have difficulty in fully understanding Japanese while building multilingual facility guides or websites, which also includes translation work
- A caregiver at a facility while also training foreign employees or technical interns
- A taxi driver who provides foreign tourists with tourist information and customer service while also interpreting information. 

Works that only require simple tasks would not be accepted, but if it is also expected to require Japanese language skills, it may be permitted.

Currently, the N1 visa is not that easy to sponsor due to the strict academic requirements, but it can be used more easy with some adaptation Specifically, I suggest you employ someone who has graduated from a Japanese university or graduate school first, and then have them get an N1, or 480 or above on the Business Japanese Proficiency Test within one year of joining the company. Both exams could be passed if they have strong reading comprehension skills. There are a wide range of good study support services available, so the company could support them in the same way as having Japanese employees prepare for their TOEIC exams.

### Specified Skilled Workers visa (Specified Skilled Workers status of residence)

Since this visa has a similar name to the Designated (Specified) Activities in Japanese mentioned earlier, this may lead to some confusion, but this is a different visa. This is a new working visa established in 2019 for the purpose of accepting foreigners who are ready to work immediately to solve the labor shortage problems in Japan. The Specified Skilled Worker (i) visa requires a considerable degree of knowledge and experience in a specific industry (see below). 

After obtaining this Specified Skilled Worker (i) and having worked for more than five years, the person becomes eligible for Specified Skilled Worker (ii). However, as of July 2021, those who could switch from Specified Skilled Worker (i) to Specified Skilled Worker (ii) are limited to two occupations: those who are in  “construction” or “shipbuilding/marine industry”.

At present, the following 14 fields are permitted for ‘Specified Skilled Workers’ visas.

1. Nursing care
1. Building cleaning
1. Materials industry
1. Electrical, electronics and information-related industry
1. Construction industry
1. Shipbuilding and marine industry
1. Automobile maintenance
1. Industrial machinery manufacturing
1. Aviation industry
1. Accommodation industry machinery manufacturing
1. Agriculture
1. Fishing industry
1. Food and drink manufacturing
1. Food service industry

Specified Skilled Workers (i) is valid for four months, six months, or one year. This visa is renewable, but the total period of stay is limited to five years. If you want to stay more, you need to change the status into Specified Skilled Workers (ⅱ).

### Requirements for obtaining a Specified Skilled Worker visa

The requirements for the foreign applicants are to pass both the Japanese Language Proficiency Test and the Specified Proficiency Test (field-specific tests). The Japanese Language Proficiency Test is very easy, as it only requires N4 or above, or the JFT (Japan Foundation Test of Basic Japanese). On the other hand, the Specified Proficiency Test requires a certain amount of time to prepare for, because in the test, there are many technical terms and perspectives that are not familiar to people outside Japan. However, many sample questions are available, so if the applicant is good at exam preparation, they could be ready in about three months.

The requirements for employers are that they must employ the foreigner on a full-time basis (permanent or contract), and the compensation must be the same or higher than Japanese employees. Whereas in the case of Technical Intern Training (技能実習), the company could continue to employ the foreigner at the minimum wage the entire time, the employment conditions for Specified Skilled Worker are based on the Japanese employees at the company, so the employer can not expect to save labor costs much. In addition, employers are obliged to provide support when hiring foreigners with Specified Skilled Worker visa, which may actually end up in increasing costs and responsibilities.

For example, employers would need to pick up foreigners who are coming to work at the airport or port, and be ready to handle complaints or give support about work and daily life. The following page explains very well regarding this, so please read it if you are interested in the details.

Details of the obligations to accept and support specified skilled workers:

- [Details of support and registered support organizations](https://www.orj.co.jp/business/tokuteigino/tokuteigino_shien/)
- [Immigration Management Agency's Specified Skilled Worker’s Guidebook](https://www.moj.go.jp/content/001326468.pdf)


Also, there’s something different with this visa from other visas. In order to employ a foreigner with the Specified Skilled Worker visa, the employer company must join the council (協議会) that is established for each industry. Only after joining that council can the company can be recognized as a ‘'specified skilled worker organization” (特定技能所属機関) under the Immigration Control Act (and thus be an organization that accepts foreigners with the Specified Skilled Worker visa).

Furthermore, in order to accept personnel from abroad on a Specified Skilled Worker visa, the employer company is required to organize pre-entry guidance, prepare accommodation, support learning Japanese language, and provide assistance with administrative procedures. This is quite difficult for companies without knowledge and experience, so there’s a system of “registration support organizations”, through which companies can outsource these support for foreigners.

Like the N1 visa, for many companies, the Specified Skilled Worker visa is not very user-friendly. This Is because since the reduction of labor costs is limited, and how companies need to bear more responsibilities, there may be less advantages to sponsoring this visa compared to the N1 visa. However, the operational requirements for this visa are expected to gradually be eased. There is much discussion on the topic, but since the visa was created in order to solve the labor shortage, it should become a system that allows companies to employ foreigners with less costs and burdens. 

At the moment, there is strong domestic and international criticism towards the Technical Intern Training (技能実習) system, so this new system is  intended to protect foreign workers more. But in reality, companies that are short labor are unlikely to be able to handle all these regulations and obligations, so the system will probably change to make it easier and more beneficial for companies to sponsor this status. Until then, it may be wise to wait and see.

## Intra-company Transferee visa (Intra-company Transferee status of residence)

Finally, it is the Intra-company Transferee visa. This is exactly what the name suggests. For instance, when there is an overseas company called “ABC Industries” and ABC Industries has a branch in Japan called “ABC Industries Japan”, employees who work at ABC Industries’ overseas office could obtain this visa when being transferred to 'ABC Industries Japan’. That means when employees are transferred from an overseas office to a branch or subsidiary in Japan they can obtain this visa. This also applies when an employee is transferred from an overseas branch or subsidiary to the head office in Japan.

Once accepted, this working visa allows the holder to engage in work related to the natural sciences, humanities, international affairs, etc. for a certain period of time. You might think “'Then why would the Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services visa not work?". The difference is that the Intra-company Transferee visa doesn’t require any educational qualifications and is available to non-university graduates. It also requires work experience, but only one year is sufficient with this visa, whereas the basic requirement for Engineer / Specialist in Humanities / International Services visa is more than 10 years, or three years for some specified occupations.

The Intra-company Transferee visa can be valid for three months, one year, three years or five years. As the transfer period should be determined in advance, the period of stay is basically in line with that transfer plan.

### Requirements for Intra-company Transferee visa status

The definition of "intra-company" is acceptable if any of the following applies:

- Transfers between parent company and subsidiaries
- Transfers between head offices, branches and sales offices
- Transfers between parent company, subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries 
- Transfer between subsidiaries
- Transfer between sub-subsidiaries
- Transfers between affiliated companies

I hope this article was informative. The types of working visas are complicated and difficult to understand, but please make sure you understand and make use of this information when hiring foreign nationals.

    <title>How I Obtained a Business Manager Visa in Japan</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/obtaining-a-business-manager-visa-in-japan"/>
    <id>https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/obtaining-a-business-manager-visa-in-japan</id>
    <published>2023-12-22T09:29:00+09:00</published>
    <updated>2023-12-22T09:29:00+09:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Bryn Dyment</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">Back in August of 2017, I was facing a tough situation. Newly divorced, I had lost my spousal visa and thus my permission to stay in Japan as well. I was in my late 40s and, although I had significant work experience, I had no university degree. I wanted to remain in Japan but I had no idea how to make that happen.

In the modern version of a cry for help, I typed “visa support” or something similar into Google and stumbled upon a local Japanese advisor, [Toyoyuki Hayashi](http://www.gaikokujin-backup.com), who specialized in helping foreigners obtain work visas. We met up, and he convinced me that his one-man operation had significant experience and extensive knowledge of the ins and outs of the Japanese immigration system.

Based on our conversation, I was told that a “Business Manager Visa” would be the most appropriate choice. We decided to work together. My spousal visa expiring, I left Japan for Canada a short time thereafter, to bide my time abroad with my fingers crossed that things might work out.

## Visa Requirements

Starting with the downsides, in my opinion the most significant one is the capital requirement: ¥5 million. However, it’s not quite as bad as it sounds. The only actual rule is that you need at least that amount of money in your business bank account on the day that they grant you your initial one-year visa. From that point forward, that money is simply working capital, and you’re free to withdraw it and even send it outside the country, so long as there is a business reason.

You also need to provide a business plan, which worried me as I was basically a hired-gun software developer rather than an actual entrepreneur or business owner. However, my advisor assured me that it was “no big deal” and helped me put together a three-page document that I was sure wouldn’t be sufficient for the Japanese immigration authorities.

One aspect of the business plan is to explain why your business needs to be in Japan at all. As a software developer, I didn’t really have a clear case, but I mentioned a personal website that I built years ago, [Real Kana](https://www.realkana.com), that showed some degree of proof that I was connected to Japan in some way. With my advisor’s prompting, I also mentioned the upcoming Olympics and my desire to assist with English-language services. I felt we were grasping at straws.

I did have a fairly extensive work history and at least one quasi-name-brand employer on my CV (Groupon), but everything was at the “individual contributor” level and there was no hint of management experience or ability anywhere in my history.

## Visa Application Process

My advisor facilitated the entire visa application process and there was minimal work for me to do. He submitted the application on my behalf in October, my confidence still low and my desire to continue my life in Japan still high.

Two months later, in January 2018, I received a tentative yes from the immigration authorities. Why “tentative”? The second part of the application process actually takes place in Japan, and the full visa approval only happens if and when I’m able to tick off the various in-Japan “todos”. I went to the Japanese consulate in Vancouver and obtained my interim visa, which gives me four months in Japan to set up my business there.

The “todos”, in summary, were:

- Find a place to live
- Incorporate my business
- Set up my business office
- Open a corporate bank account
- Register with various government offices (Employees' Health Insurance System, etc.)

My advisor was a godsend during this process, as my Japanese language ability was (and still is) remarkably weak given how long I’ve been here. The two most challenging items from the above list were the business office and the bank account.

### Setting up a Business Office

Officially, I need to have a separate business office that “looks and feels” as such: business signage, a proper desk and office accessories, etc. I did not want that as it made little-to-no sense for remote software development, my bread-and-butter activity. Rather than spend maybe ¥50,000 per month on a reasonable office with internet connectivity, etc., I really wanted to instead get a nicer place to live that had a dedicated (or dedicated-looking) office area.

I asked my advisor if this was a possibility. One thing I like very much about him is his flexibility and curiosity, this being no exception. In addition to the hemming and hawing, he also said, “well, let’s try and see”. This was Kyoto and I rented a Kyoto machiya, put a simple corporate sign up front (with permission in advance from my landlord), threw together an official-looking office area in the front room, and provided photos of all the above for the immigration office. It worked.

### Opening a Corporate Bank Account
My advisor told me that this process would probably be the most challenging, as it’s notoriously hard to open a bank account with a short-term visa and mine was extremely short-term. (I was still here under my four-month visa.) It was hard to believe him, though, as I had already been tentatively approved for a proper visa subject only to taking care of a few formalities.

He didn’t even want to try with the national banks, and chose a small regional bank instead (Bank of Kyoto). They turned out to be perfectly happy to take my business and, after taking care of the remaining formalities, again with the extensive help of my advisor, my actual visa was approved.

## Corporate Responsibility

I was now the managing director and sole shareholder of a proper Japanese corporation. It was a bit exciting and cool-sounding, but it came with responsibilities as well (something that I’ve learned is not my forte in life). Annual meetings, proper accounting, health insurance contributions, tax returns, all with reams of associated paperwork, and all in Japanese.

We’ve arrived at the single most important paragraph in this article. Looking back at all that has happened with respect to my visa, far and away the smartest thing I did was find an outstanding advisor: professional, hard-working, results-oriented, resourceful, honest, knowledgeable, and, to top it off, inexpensive. I joke with him that he is my savior and my guardian angel but it doesn’t feel like a joke to me: he helped me out significantly at a point in my life where my confidence was low, my ignorance high, and my options seemingly limited.

I had thought that my advisor would (with a bit of luck) get me my visa and then we’d part ways, but I am working with him all these years later. He is my konbini, my one-stop shopping, my lifeline for all things corporate and official in Japan.

My visa has been renewed four times now, with the most recent renewal being for three years (the first three were one-year renewals). I have moved my company from Kyoto to Tokyo and set up a similar “corporate office” in my home here. My bank is now SMBC after the Bank of Kyoto decided against issuing me a credit card, my sole negative experience with them and the one thing that cost them my business.

## Day-to-Day Business

Since being issued my visa, 95% of my income has come from a series of full-time programming positions. The first was a design/UX studio in Arizona, then Unity’s Tokyo office (my sole in-Japan position so far), then two tiny startups (one in California, one in France), and now my current position with a California startup. Technically, my company was a vendor/contractor for all the above, but in effect it was equivalent to a normal employee-style relationship. And, notably, none of the above companies had a problem with the arrangement, which I actually found a bit surprising. (I always mentioned it early on so as not to waste anyone's time if it'd be a hassle for them.)

The remainder of my income has been smaller contracts and various one-off things. One restriction of the business manager visa is that all business activities must be run through the company, so even a small paid project is “company business”.

## Closing Thoughts

Why was I granted a business manager visa? Was it the mention of my personal website? A somewhat-recognizable company name on my CV? Or, as I suspect, the simple fact that I was a fairly experienced software developer with a reasonable work history to back it up? I’m pretty sure that was it, but of course I’ll never know.

What do I think of the Japanese immigration experience? From my perspective, I am enthusiastically supportive. The entire process felt efficient and fair (e.g., not penalizing my lack of a university degree, a hard requirement for most visa processes).

I have recently remarried, to a Japanese national, but have decided to maintain my business manager visa status rather than switch to a spousal visa. Not only is it fun and cool to be independent, it is also more comforting for me after the actual trauma of my prior experience. Before too long, I will qualify for permanent residence and am very much looking forward to finally being here on a more permanent footing.

    <title>Web Accessibility in Japan: What Developers Need to Know</title>

    <content type="html">Many people with disabilities use assistive technology, which allows them to access websites in ways different from most people. People who are blind, for example, use screen readers to convert website content into audio. Some use braille displays. There are also people who use magnifiers to read text. Those who cannot use a mouse navigate websites use keyboards or other special alternative input devices. Some navigate using voice recognition instead of a keyboard.

As web developers, there are things we can do to improve accessibility for our users. These are set out in documents like the WC3’s [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). One rule you’re probably already aware of is to provide alternative text for visual information like images for individuals who are blind. Another example is all interactive elements should be designed to be operable through keyboard input. But there are many more of these rules, with the WCAG 2.2 formalizing 87 of them.

The extent to which these rules need to be followed vary from country to country. For the last 3 years, I’ve been working as an accessibility consultant in Japan. However, most of my clients are in the US, which has some of the most strict regulations around accessibility. This means that despite being a native of Japan, I know relatively little about the state of accessibility in the country.

I do know someone who is an expert though: [Makoto Ueki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/makoto-ueki-b8667313/), who I co-organize [A11yTokyo](https://www.meetup.com/a11ytokyo/), an accessibility meetup, with (among others). Makoto runs the web accessibility consultancy [Infoaxia](https://infoaxia.co.jp), where his clients are primarily large Japanese corporations, some of whom have come to him because they’ve been sued in the US over their poor accessibility, though recently more are becoming proactive about it. He works with his clients directly to audit their websites for accessibility, and also provides them training on the topic. Additionally, he is involved in the development of W3C's WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guideline) and the Japanese national standard, the JIS.

With this background, Makoto was the perfect person to help me understand accessibility in Japan, and so I interviewed him on the topic.


## Does Japan have laws mandating web accessibility?

The Act on the Elimination of Disability Discrimination was enacted in 2016. Japan had never had a law equivalent to the ADA in the United States, the Equality Act 2010 in the United Kingdom, or the DDA (Disability Discrimination Act) in Australia. However, that law was not a mandate for accessibility, but merely an obligation to make an effort.

As of April 2024, the law has been amended. If there is a problem with accessibility and there is a request from a person with disabilities or an organization for people with disabilities, companies must provide “reasonable accommodations” "unless it poses an undue burden." What constitutes an "undue burden" is something that will be defined over time.

There is also a problem that many people with disabilities either do not know about the law or, even if they do, they do not know how to act based on it and thus give up. According to a survey of 2,000 people, 40% did not know about the law.


## You mentioned that more Japanese companies are committing to accessibility even though the law does not enforce it. Why do you think that is?

I think there are mainly three reasons: 

* American influence
* Aging society
* Employees’ grassroots activities in corporates

Firstly, the influence of the US is significant, as there has been an increase in lawsuits over accessibility issues on the websites of Japanese corporations that have expanded into America. Due to such pressure, the Japanese side of those companies are also starting to improve accessibility. I hear that the laws are also getting stricter in EU member states, so maybe pressure from the EU will increase in the near future.

Moreover, the benefits of accessibility are not limited to people with disabilities. By improving accessibility, it is also possible to reach the older people whose abilities change as they age. As you know, Japan is rapidly becoming an aging society with fewer children. The current generation of elderly people does not use electronic devices much, but soon the “Famicom generation” will become elderly. They are a generation that has used computers for work. Consequently, there will be more elderly people who want to purchase goods and services through the internet. Companies are starting to commit to accessibility in anticipation of this. Kao Corporation is a good example. They aim to deliver product information to everyone and are working on it Kao group-wide.

Also, the concept of accessibility itself, though gradually, is becoming more known than in the past, and there are companies that are increasing their commitment from the grassroots level due to the thoughts of individual employees. In the last one to two years, I feel that the number of people who want to work on accessibility in a corporation has increased.

SEO used to be another factor. About 20 years ago, working on accessibility alone could lead to a significant improvement in SEO. Google’s SEO guidelines and accessibility guidelines overlap considerably, as both search engines and screen readers interpret HTML code in a similar mechanical fashion.  However, search engine algorithms are no longer as simple as they were before, and so tackling accessibility is now merely a prerequisite before improving SEO. 


## Are there more front-end engineers with knowledge of accessibility now?

Yes and no. Recently, the number of front-end engineers who do not know any code at all has been increasing. Some markup with just &amp;lt;div&gt; and CSS and JavaScript using no-code tools, not writing semantic HTML code, which is a big mistake in terms of accessibility. While I do not deny the possibility that, with the development of AI and no-code tools in the future, even those without knowledge will be able to create accessible sites, it’ll take some more time.

Web development has become popular, and indeed, it may feel like there is a saturation of web developers, but there is a real shortage of those who can build accessible sites. For example, engineers in the United States who understand HTML and have experience in creating accessible sites as a matter of course would be highly valued in Japan if they could speak Japanese or work well in a Japanese work environment. 

As I mentioned earlier, although accessibility is becoming more prominent in Japan, it is still a small community, and outside this community, many people have never heard the word and do not understand it at all. There is a significant opportunity for engineers who have gained such experience abroad.

## Are there any issues specific to Japanese regarding web accessibility?

Surprisingly few.

I have been participating in the W3C guidelines working group and had proposed rules to be added from a Japanese perspective. Around 2004, when WCAG 2.0 was being created, JIS working group proposed rules for edge cases that were not in WCAG but were in JIS, and the W3C working group had accepted to include all of them into WCAG.

### Use of space

Japanese sites often use a space within a word. For example, some sites write "日時" (date and time) as "日　時" just to make it looks visually nice. If it's written as "日時," a screen reader can correctly pronounce it as "にちじ(ni-chi-ji)," but if it's written as "日　時," the screen reader will read it as "ひ　とき(hi toki)." We proposed a rule to forbid including a white space between characters in a word, thinking it was a problem unique to Japanese. But when I shared the issue , they said that there could be the same issue in English. For example, there are cases in English-speaking countries where each letter is spaced out like "W E L C O M E," and a rule forbidding this was added to WCAG in [Success Criterion 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#meaningful-sequence).

### Furigana

Japanese kanji characters are very difficult for every Japanese person. There are many kanji with difficult readings, and that's the same for screen readers. Also, some people with intellectual disabilities need furigana when reading text. English is a phonetic script, so I thought this would definitely be a Japanese-only issue, and W3C wouldn't accept it. However, it was accepted as [Success Criterion 3.1.6 Pronunciation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pronunciation). In English, too, there are difficult-to-pronounce words, and a rule was made to provide a mechanism to understand the pronunciation.

*Furigana (ふりがな) is a Japanese reading aid consisting of smaller kana (syllabic characters) printed either above or next to kanji (logographic characters) or other characters to indicate their pronunciation. It is one type of ruby text. Furigana is also known as yomigana (読み仮名) and rubi (ルビ) in Japanese.

![Two Japanese words are written side-by-side. The word is “Kanji” written in kanji: one is horizontal and the other one is vertical. For the vertical one, rubi is on the right side of each kanji character, and for the horizontal one, rubi is above each kanji character.](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjAzOTIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--35b820fe10f4c245166e32e1400488deef2e2bc6/Screenshot%202023-12-21%20at%209.10.02.png)

*Image and definition of [Furigana by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana)*

### Sensory Characteristics

Japanese websites often have phrases like "click the button on the lower right" or "click the square button." We thought this might be a culture unique to Japan, but it turns out there's the same problem in English-speaking countries. WCAG already had a success criterion to not use color only to convey information and make it understandable even when someone cannot recognize the difference in color. However, WCAG did not have a success criterion to prevent using only shape, position, or direction to convey information that JIS had. So the JIS working group proposed it and it was added as [Success Criterion 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#sensory-characteristics).


### Double-byte characters

It was tough when UTF8 didn't exist. 15-20 years ago, Shift-JS was the mainstream. Since English is single-byte, it was difficult to include double-byte characters when I was localizing an accessibility testing tool originally developed in the USl. But that's not a problem anymore as we are using UTF-8 now.


### Japanese document mixed with foreign words

In Japanese sentences, alphabet words can be mixed in such as "About Us". It's mostly in English, but it depends on the case. When inserting a foreign words, you need to enclose the characters in a `&lt;span&gt;` and add a lang attribute like `&lt;span lang="en"&gt;some text in english&lt;/span&gt;`.

Then, the screen reader can recognize the change in language, which allows it to pronounce correctly. This had been in WCAG without the suggestion from the Japan side in [Success Criterion 3.1.2 Language of Parts](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#language-of-parts). However, having a screen reader pronounce text in a native fashion can make it challenging for users who aren’t fluent English speakers to understand. So it is recommended to only use this feature when conveying the native pronunciation in English is essential to understand the text.  


## Do you have any thoughts about web accessibility in Japan?

I have conducted in-house training on web accessibility for many companies over the years and also given my talks at the seminars and conferences for web designers and developers. A common comment I get, which hasn't changed over time is, "I thought accessibility was something more special and time-consuming. I was surprised to know that most of the things we need to do are the basics of the basics in web design and development."

The first step is to understand what exactly needs to be done by understanding what the accessibility guidelines require. Too many people who avoid web accessibility work without knowing about what to do in the first place.

You might be surprised to know that there are many quick accessibility improvements you can make. Some can be fixed with small UI changes or even without any visual changes. Others are easy to fix once you understand how to use HTML elements and attributes. Accessibility is not an incredibly complicated and time-consuming grand project when you understand what to do. </content>

    <updated>2023-12-19T10:55:00+09:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Paul McMahon</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">I previously wrote about [how my lost MacBook was returned to me with an Activation Lock on it](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/not-setting-up-find-my-bricked-my-macbook), and how Apple refused to unlock it for me. Well, I did manage to finally get it unlocked. All it took was an email to Tim Cook. I don’t know how repeatable this process is, but here’s what happened.

After publishing the article, it somehow [reached the top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37865941). I’d hoped that would trigger someone from Apple to reach out to me, but no one did.

I also shared it with a much smaller audience: a Discord server that I run for English speaking software developers in Japan. [Our moderator](https://www.tokyodev.com/authors/scott-rothrock) pointed out that he’d had success in the past by emailing tcook@apple.com, as he’d done so in the past and had his assistants escalate things to people who could resolve them for him. 

Having exhausted other avenues, I gave it a shot:

&gt; Subject: Activation Lock support requests denied
&gt;
&gt; My lost MacBook was returned to me with Activation Lock on. Despite providing my receipt from the Apple Store, my request to remove the lock has been denied. I wrote an article about my experience that got to the top of the popular social media site "Hacker News". I'd love to have a happy ending to this frustrating story.

Four business days later I got a response from one of Tim’s executive assistants in Japan. From there, we exchanged emails and phone calls over the next two weeks, where the assistant was able to get to the bottom of things.

They explained to me that the MacBook was wiped in the middle of August (after I had lost it) and then reported lost by a newly created iCloud account with an email address starting with “p”. My requests to have it unlocked were being rejected as per their policy of not unlocking devices reported as lost, even if an original proof of purchase is provided. However, because of the documentation I was able to provide, they were convinced that it was my MacBook, and thus unlocked it.

Would this have worked had I not been able to reference the article's performance on Hacker News? I’m not sure, but it seems likely that was at least a contributing factor. After all, I didn’t actually provide the assistant with any more proof than I had submitted with the activation unlock request. That being said, if you have an issue that can’t be resolved via normal channels, emailing Tim Cook is worth a shot.

## What really happened to my MacBook

By this time, I’d already purchased a replacement machine, and so getting the MacBook unlocked was as much about the principle of things as anything else. However, I also wanted my curiosity sated as to what had actually happened.

Apple had provided me with “how” it got locked: the computer was wiped, locked to a new iCloud account, then reported as lost. They didn’t give me the “why” though. Though my original article mentioned it as a theoretical possibility, I saw no incentive for the person who returned my MacBook to do this. So I emailed the person about it reseting the laptop, and after a couple of emails back and forth, I found out more or less what happened.

While the person didn't reset it themselves, they did take it to a shop, and asked them to unlock it. The shop didn't unlock it, however, they did reset it. This wasn't obvious to the person, but they reported that while my login profile information was visible before they gave it to the shop, it wasn't afterwards, presumably as the Activation Lock was on.

Despite the shop not having unlocked it for the person, they reported that the shop asked to be paid. When pressed on why the shop asked to be paid despite the shop not unlocking it, the person stopped responding.

My theory is that the shop reset the MacBook and reported it as lost with a new Apple ID in order to extort the person.

Perhaps the person didn't want to admit it, but they actually paid money to the shop, who initially gave it back to them "unlocked". Later the shop could lock it again by reporting it as lost, as a way to ask for more money from the person again. 

Or maybe the shop wanted to ensure they’d be the only one able to unlock it, and so returned the MacBook, telling the person that they found a way to unlock it, but only if the person paid a higher fee than they were willing to pay.

This would explain why the iCloud address started with “p”. The shop saw my name was “Paul McMahon” from the login screen, and so they created an email address that sounded like it could be mine to give them plausible deniability when the person saw the lock screen.

## Apple doesn’t consider this to be a security vulnerability, but maybe it should

When first activating a MacBook, Apple makes it easy to skip setting up FindMy. But given the severe consequences for not doing so, I think they either need to revise the setup workflow to make this downside abundantly clear, or revisit their unlock policy altogether.

While I was an edge case, having my MacBook taken to an unscrupulous shop by someone who didn’t own it, similarly unscrupulous shops could do the same thing to others. After all, I even wondered about the possibility that I had set up an iCloud email in the past, and had somehow activated the computer with it. 

I reported this to [Apple Security Research](https://security.apple.com), but it was dismissed with “We’re unable to identify a security issue in your report.” I suppose I could have asked my contact at Apple to flag it for further review, but at this point, I’m ready to let it go.</content>

    <title>The Remarkable Decline in Home Burglary Rates in Japan</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/home-burglary-rates-in-japan"/>
    <id>https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/home-burglary-rates-in-japan</id>
    <published>2023-12-18T11:37:00+09:00</published>

    </author>
    <content type="html">I stumbled across an amazing fact. From 2003 to 2022, the number of home burglaries in Japan decreased by a factor of 12! Home burglaries in Japan peaked in 2003, with 190,473 cases in Japan. But as of 2022, where the most recent data is available, they have dropped to a mere 15,692 cases.

This drop was astonishing to me, and so I sought out the reasons behind it. While there isn’t a simple answer, [a report](https://www.moj.go.jp/content/001220466.pdf) by the Ministry of Justice points to several factors such as a lower unemployment rate, an increase in crime prevention volunteers, and higher building security standards.

The connection with the unemployment rate is obvious. According to Japanese crime statistics, unemployed people are disproportionately likely to commit burglary, car/vehicle theft, and pickpocketing. Just as the home burglary rate was spiking in the early 2000s, so too was the unemployment rate.

 
![Chart showing home burglaries vs unemployment rate](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjAyNDksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--52caad32923978943fc87045b17fe90cc4cf61ed/chart-2.png)


But the unemployment rate alone doesn’t seem to fully explain the drop. For instance, while the financial crisis in 2009 caused the unemployment rate to spike back up, residential burglaries continued to plummet.

Crime prevention volunteer groups also increased dramatically over the last two decades, growing from approximately 180,000 members in 2003 to 2.34 million in 2007.

![Chart showing home burglaries vs crime prevention group members](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjAyNDgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--ca5c25cf0961461368403f76addbf8ca99c93490/chart.png)

This was in response to the “Action plan for the realization of a crime-resistant society” created by the Japanese government, which sought not only to prevent crime on a national level, but also in each local community through encouraging more people to volunteer, increasing police patrols, and building stronger relationships with neighbors. These efforts have been explored in [Crime prevention in Japan orchestration, representation and impact of a volunteering boom](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756061618300727).

As crime was peaking, several organizations came together to establish the “[Public-private joint conference on the development and dissemination of building components with high security performance](https://www.npa.go.jp/safetylife/seianki26/theme_b/b_c_1.html)” in 2002. This organization analyzed residential burglaries, discussed the security standard of building components to prevent break-ins, and tested the security performance of components. Based on their test report, they identified 15 types of building components that had an actual effect on security, such as making a break in take longer than five minutes.

This downward trend of home burglaries may finally be coming to an end. In 2022, for the first time in the last two decades, the overall number of reported crimes increased to 601,331 cases, reflecting a 5.9% increase from 2021. While residential burglaries had declined over the same year, there is not much room for them to decrease any further. Whether the burglary rate stabilizes at its current level or reverses, only time will tell.</content>

TokyoDevは僕の個人的なブログとしてスタートしました。日本で開発者として過ごす日々を綴ったブログが、今では、僕がこれだけで食べていけるぐらいの利益を生み出す求人サイト事業へと成長しました。数百人の開発者が日本での最初の仕事をTokyoDevで見つけていて、文字通り、彼らの人生を変えたのです。誰かの人生に影響を与えている。これほどやりがいを感じられることはありません。

最初にブログを始めたときは、事業化しようとは考えていませんでした。でもTokyoDevは、まるで長い旅のように、15年かけてゆっくり自然に成長してきました。この記事では、こじんまりと始まった個人ブログが利益を生む求人サイトとなり、月に数万人が訪れるコミュニティへと進化したストーリーをお話しします。


## ドメインを取得

僕は、2008年にtokyodev.comのドメインを取得しました。当時、東京の会社でソフトウェアエンジニアとして働いていて、新しいビジネスチャンスを模索しようとしていました。それまでは[hotmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook.com)のメールアドレスを使っていたのですが、独自ドメインのほうがプロフェッショナルな印象を与えられるかなと考えたのです。あまり深く考えず、短くてわかりやすいし取得可能なドメインだったので、tokyodev.comというドメインにしました。

「プロフェッショナル」なメールアドレスのために取得したものの、その後かつての同僚2人とコンサルティングビジネスを始めたことから、使う機会はないままでした。数年は簡単な個人プロフィールを載せていただけで、ほとんど何も掲載していませんでした。


## 日本の技術系イベントについてブログを書き始める

2010年、日本最大のRubyカンファレンスである[RubyKaigi](https://rubykaigi.org/2010/en/)に参加しました。Rubyを作ったのが日本人なので、Ruby周辺のコミュニティは日本で一番活気があるコミュニティの一つです。この頃、Ruby on Railsの成功により、世界中がRubyに関心を寄せていました。その流れで、ほぼ日本人のための日本のイベントだったRubyKaigiは、海外からの登壇者が多く参加する国際的なイベントに変わっていたのです。

そこに参加した僕は、海外から来日した登壇者の多くが、同じく海外からきた登壇者や僕のような日本在住の外国人としか交流していないことに気づきました。僕自身は、そういう人と知り合える機会がありがたかった一方で、グローバルのRubyコミュニティと日本のRubyコミュニティの間に壁があるように感じました。そして、日本に住んでいる外国人エンジニアという立場の僕だからこそ、この壁を取り払えるのではないかと考えたのです。

そこで、RubyKaigiの後、日本と海外のRubyデベロッパをつなぐことを目標にした[Tokyo Rubyist Meetup](https://trbmeetup.doorkeeper.jp/)というイベントを立ち上げました。自分のイベントだけでなく、すでにある日本のコミュニティにも積極的に参加したいと思い、東京のデベロッパイベントに顔を出し始めました。平均して週に1~2件のイベントには参加しました。

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;当時のブログ記事&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


数々のすばらしいイベントに参加するにつれ、日本のコミュニティで起こっていることを世界中に知ってほしいと思うようになり、tokyodev.comでそういったイベントのことをブログで書き始めました。


## 転機となったメール

そして2011年8月、こんな内容のメールを受信しました。


&gt; Ruby on Railsを最近知り、非常に興味を持った者です。日本でRuby関連の仕事に就けないかと探すうちにあなたのウェブサイトとブログを見つけました。自己紹介をしたかったのと、あなたが日本でデベロッパとして働くようになった話を聞けないかと思い、メールを送りました。日本でキャリアを始めるためのアドバイスをもらえませんか。

ブログに問い合わせが来たのは、これが初めてでした。僕と同じ道をたどろうとしている人を助けられることが嬉しくて、さっそく返事を書こうとしました。でも書き出してみると、他にもこういう内容を知りたい人がいるかもしれないと思えてきました。そこで、「[どうやって僕が日本にソフトウェアデベロッパとして来たか](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/finding-a-job-as-a-ruby-developer-in-japan)」というタイトルで、ブログに投稿してみたのです。



&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdXBOIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--270124989384faec5e6f265525772545102f2df5/unnamed-5.png" alt="最初に掲載した時のそのブログ記事"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;最初に掲載した時のそのブログ記事&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

僕が知る限りでは、そのようなトピックに関して英語で書かれた記事は他にありませんでした。そのため、「software developer job in Japan」といった検索ワードの検索結果では、当然、僕の記事が一番最初に表示されるようになりました。そうすると、日本でデベロッパの仕事を探すには？といった質問がもっと来るようになりました。そんな質問が来るたびに回答をブログで書くことを続けているうちに、どんどん大きく広がっていきました。


## メーリングリストを開始

そのうち、日本の会社で日本語不要のソフトウェアデベロッパを探しているという話が耳に入ってくるようになりました。そういう求人はどこでも公開されていないことが多かったのですが、コミュニティに積極的に参加する中で耳にするようになっていったのです。そこで、2012年10月に、そういった求人情報を配信するメーリングリストを始めました。

それから2年ぐらいの間に、そのメーリングリストに合計12件のメールを配信しました。2014年11月までには、345人の人がメーリングリストに登録していました。インターネットの世界では大した数字ではないですが、僕のメーリングリストを通してすでに何人かが日本での職を得たと聞いていたので、無意味ではないことは確かでした。


## メーリングリストを有料化

最初にメーリングリストを始めたときは、ただ誰かを助けたいという気持ちでした。そのため、それを事業化することを目標にしていたわけではありませんでした。でも、僕が配信した求人情報で仕事を見つけたという成功体験を聞くことが増え、そして同時に、日本では雇用が成立した人の年収の30%をリクルーターに支払っているといることも知りました。僕のメーリングリストはリクルーターとまったく同じサービスではありません。でも、企業から報酬を受け取れるはずのサービスを無料で提供していたわけです。

そこで、「無料で提供した分のお金」をいくらか回収しようと考えました。求人掲載したい企業の妨げにならない報酬体系なら、それまでと変わらずデベロッパを助けることもできます。一番いい方法はリクルーターと同じ成果報酬制だと考え、採用した際に報酬を受け取ることにしました。

僕のメーリングリストを使っていたのは、ネットワーキングイベントなどで個人的に知り合った企業ばかりでした。だから、簡単な契約を交わしつつも、基本的にはお互いの信頼に委ねた契約でした。つまり、求職者は企業に直接応募し、採用が決まったら僕に知らせてもらうというものです。そんな契約に基づいて求人を掲載した最初の企業は、予想に反することなくデベロッパを採用することに成功しました。


&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdXROIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--06b432c4179a27b7b4d7082bbf463c6d8a44046f/unnamed-6.png" alt="求人サービスについて掲載した最初のページ"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;求人サービスについて掲載した最初のページ&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

掲載する求人の数が増えると、個人的なつながりがない企業からも依頼が来るようになりました。そういった企業とは僕自身は面識はないものの、やはり信頼関係に基づいた契約にして、誰かを採用した場合には知らせてもらうようにしました。この話をいろんな人にすると、それでビジネスが成り立っていることによく驚かれます。でも、これが日本で事業をする上で素晴らしいことの一つだと思っています。信頼に基づいた契約をした取引先を、ちゃんと信頼できるのですから。

もちろん、採用をした企業が知らせてくれないケースがなかったわけではありません。でも、そういった企業はこちらが申し立てをすると、大概は「きちんと把握できていなかった」と言って、支払うべき報酬を払ってくれます。こういった問題が起こるのは非常に稀なので、見張りを強化するのも無駄に思えました。


## メーリングリストから求人サイトへ

当初は数百人の登録者だったメーリングリストですが、2018年には5,000人以上にまで増えていました。また、数ヶ月に一度、1件のメールを配信する以外はほとんど手間もかからなかったのが、ほぼ毎週メールを配信することになり、やらなければいけないことも増えていました。

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdTVOIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--a84abe1c5b337abc515fa5b5850da5f982fe722b/unnamed-7.png" alt="求人サイトとしてのTokyoDevが始まった頃"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;求人サイトとしてのTokyoDevが始まった頃&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

でも、サイトは僕の個人ブログの時と大して変わらず、求人情報はメーリングリストでしか見れないままでした。時間が経つにつれ、この方法では満足できないブログ読者から指摘されるようになっていました。例えば、過去の求人が見れないとか、友人に求人情報をシェアしにくいといったことです。そのような指摘を受けて「求人掲示板」コーナーをブログに追加。メーリングリストに掲載した求人情報をそこにも載せることにしました。そしてその後、[デザイナー](https://mathieumayer.com/)と一緒に、ブログ全体を求人情報を中心としたサイトに作り変えました。


## 本格的な事業へ

2019年には、僕がメインでやっていた仕事の稼ぎを超えて、TokyoDevが僕の最大の収入源になりました。この年にTokyoDevが拡大した理由を特定するのは難しいのですが、いくつかの要因があったと考えています。

まず、2018年の終わりに[Indeed](https://www.tokyodev.com/companies/indeed)がクライアントに加わりました。僕が主催した[CTOを対象にしたイベント](https://ctotalktokyo.doorkeeper.jp/)に、Indeedのエンジニアマネジャーが参加したことがきっかけです。その頃、Indeedは日本の年収を大幅に上回る米国の年収レベルで外国人デベロッパを大量採用し、日本のテックシーンをざわつかせていました。Indeedが顧客の名前に加わることで、他の企業が見に来た際にもTokyoDevに箔がつきます。

二つ目の要因は、個人的なブログのメーリングリストではなく、求人サイト事業としてTokyoDevを運営し、人にも話すようになっていたことです。ちゃんとした事業として見てもらうことでIndeedのような他企業にとってより使いやすく、関係者の理解も得やすくなったのだと思います。

三つ目は、新しく獲得した顧客に対しては、それまでよりも高い報酬額に設定したこと。一件の採用に対する利益が大幅に増えました。

四つ目は、かつてTokyoDevを使ったスタートアップ企業が成長し、その後6人ぐらいのデベロッパを続けざまにTokyoDevで採用したこと。

そして最後の要因は、日本のスタートアップ企業で国際色豊かなエンジニアチームを作ることが急速に一般的になったことです。そのため、メーリングリストを始めたときに比べて、マーケット自体が大きく成長していました。

こうして成功を掴み始めたTokyoDev。僕は他の事業をやめて、TokyoDevに注力することを決めました。


## 新型コロナウィルスの影響

2020年初めに新型コロナウィルスが世界中に広がった頃、日本は新しいビザ（査証）の発行を停止しました。TokyoDevで採用された多くのエンジニアは海外から日本への移住を希望していましたが、日本の厳しい入国管理規制でそれが難しい状況に。日本への入国と移住を前提にした採用を、成功報酬制で受け取ることになっていたため、成長が鈍化し、2020年はその前年よりもわずかに増収する程度の成長にとどまりました。

ところが2021年と2022年、TokyoDevは爆発的な成長をとげました。2020年の間に停止していたすべての採用が入国緩和に伴って再開され、前の年の成功報酬が支払われたことが要因の一つです。それに加えて、企業のグローバル採用の体系の変化も影響しました。

新型コロナウィルス以前は、ほとんどの日本企業は出社を前提とした経営をしていました。しかしパンデミックにより、ほとんど全ての企業がリモートワークに移行。それまでは採用プロセスも対人が基本だったのが、全てオンラインで実施されるようになりました。様々な運用において新しいスタンダードが生まれたことで、海外在住者の採用にも対応しやすくなったと言えます。また、リモートワークに慣れた日本企業は、ビザ申請の許可が下りるまでにリモートでの採用を進めることができるようになりました。これにより採用のスピードも速くなり、その結果、多くの企業が海外からの人材採用により高い期待を寄せるようになりました。


## 一人事業から事業を拡大

TokyoDevの運営にはほとんどコストがかかっていなかったので、生み出された利益はすべて僕の収入となっていました。しかし、自分だけの利益を追求する代わりに、その収益を事業へ再投資したらどんな可能性が開けるだろうかと考えるようになりました。また、僕のサイトを利用している開発者たちに支えられて、私一人が豊かになっていくことに、どこか罪悪感を感じていました。

そこで2022年、僕の一人事業から脱却し、事業を拡大させていくことを決心。進行中のプロジェクトごとに関わってもらう人を増やしていきました。そして現在、TokyoDevでは6人が業務委託契約で働いています（フルタイムで働いているのは僕だけですが）。

スタッフを迎えてよかったことはいくつもありますが、一つは、TokyoDev自体がスタッフ2人のワーキングビザ更新をスポンサーしたことで、僕自信がビザ更新の手続きがどんなものかが実践でわかったことです。手続き自体は難しくないですし、こうした自分の経験に基づいて他の企業に「大丈夫ですよ、心配ないですよ」と安心させてあげることができるからです。

かつては僕が1人で書いていたTokyoDevのブログは、今では僕以外に8人のライターを抱えています。だから、僕だけではく、他のデベロッパの経験も紹介することができるようになりました。[女性として](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/working-as-a-female-software-developer-in-japan)、[フィリピン人として、](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/filipino-software-developers-in-japan)そして[障がい者として](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/disabilities-in-japan-and-the-disability-certificate-shougaisha-techou)、日本で働くのがどのようなものかを当事者であるソフトウェアデベロッパが綴った記事もあります。このライターたちはTokyoDevのDiscordコミュニティのメンバーです。幅広い視点や考えに触れることができることが、彼ら／彼女らと協業するすばらしいメリットの一つだと思っています。

また、TokyoDevは日本のデベロッパコミュニティへの協賛も始めました（[とりわけテック業界の女性を支援するコミュニティ](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/supporting-communities-women-technology)）。そもそもTokyoDevを始めるきっかけになったのがコミュニティだったので、原点に帰るような想いですし、TokyoDevを成長させてくれたコミュニティに恩返しができることを嬉しく思っています。

純粋にビジネスの観点から見ると、こういった出費がTokyoDevを成長させてくれたり利益拡大に直接的に貢献しているかはわかりません。2023年がまもなく終わろうとしていますが、利益だけで見るとTokyoDevは昨年と同じぐらいで着地しようとしていますから。でも、昨年は米国のテックシーンが崩壊しました。日本のテック企業はそれほど影響を受けなかったとは言え、求人マーケット自体は[より競争が激しくなっています](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/developer-job-market-in-japan-2023)。だからこれらの投資がなければ、今年のTokyoDevの業績は現状よりも悪かったかもしれません。

一方、僕たちの最大のミッションである「海外エンジニアの日本でのキャリアスタートやキャリアアップをサポートする」という観点でいうと、紛れもなく成功だったと言えます。

## TokyoDevがうまくいった理由

TokyoDevは決して一夜にして成功したわけではありません。有料化するまでに5年もブログを書いていましたし、目に見えて大きなリターンを得るまでにはさらにそこから5年かかりました。最初から本格的な事業にすることをゴールにしていたら、果てしなく長く思えたでしょう。でも、金銭的な野望がなかった僕にとっては、物事が進むのが遅すぎると感じることはありませんでした。

とはいえ、こうやって自分自身のストーリーを振り返ってみると、すべてがあるべきところに落ち着いたし、事業として成功できたことは本当にラッキーだったと思います。でも一つだけ確実に言えることは、僕のチャンスのすべては、イベントとコミュニティ、そして人とのつながりに導かれたということです。

参加したイベントを世界に知ってもらいたいと書いたブログ。それが、日本でデベロッパになるってどんな感じだろうと興味を持つ人や、同じように日本でデベロッパとして働くにはどうしたらいいかを知りたい人とのつながりを生んでくれました。

参加したイベントやコミュニティを通して、そこ以外では知り得なかった求人の情報を手に入れられて、一番最初のクライアントも獲得できました。彼らは報酬を払ってでも僕のメーリングリストに求人を進んで掲載しようとしてくれたし、採用が成功したら僕に教えてくれるはずと彼らを信じることができました。それができたのは他でもなく、みんな知り合いだったから。

Indeedのような有名企業と仕事をするという次のチャンスも、イベントがきっかけで訪れました。僕自身をイベントで目立った存在にすることで、TokyoDevを大いに生かせる力を持ったIndeedの担当者のアンテナに引っかかることができたのです。

お互いに助け合うコミュニティという場所で活動的になることの意義を、この記事で知ってもらえると嬉しいです。TokyoDevのミッションは人を助けることです。そしてミッションを体現するかのように、いつも誰かを、そしてより多くの人を助けるコミュニティへとTokyoDevはこの瞬間も成長しています。最近は、[Discordのコミュニティ](https://discord.com/invite/seUNe38YgV)を成長させることに注力してきたのですが、今、僕たちのDiscordコミュニティは日本国内外の人をつなげるすばらしい場所になっています。

TokyoDevが次はどこへ向かっていくのか、楽しみで仕方ありません。</content>

TokyoDev started out as my personal blog talking about developer life in Japan, but has evolved into a job board that is a thriving business that is my sole source of income. But even more than that, it is incredibly personally fulfilling. The site has literally altered the trajectories of hundreds of people’s lives by helping them get their first developer job in Japan. It has been very rewarding for me to see that impact first-hand.

When I first started the blog, I wasn’t intending to make a business out of it. My journey has been one of slow organic growth over the last 15 years. This is the story of how the site has evolved from its humble origins as my personal blog to a flourishing job board and community that serves tens of thousands of visitors per month.

## Registering the domain

I registered tokyodev.com in 2008. At the time, I was working as a software developer at a company in Tokyo, and had decided it was time to start exploring new job opportunities. I had been using a [Hotmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook.com) email address, but I felt having my own domain would make me look more like a professional. I didn’t think hard about it and chose tokyodev.com as it was short, descriptive of me, and available.

The “professional” email address never became relevant, as I ended up starting a consultancy with two of my former colleagues. For the next couple of years, the domain lay empty, with nothing more than a simple personal profile on it.

## Starting a blog about tech events in Japan

In 2010, I attended [RubyKaigi](https://rubykaigi.org/2010/en/), Japan’s largest Ruby conference. As the creator of Ruby is Japanese, the community around the language is one of the most vibrant developer communities in Japan. Around this time, the success of Ruby on Rails had created a global interest in Ruby. RubyKaigi changed from a primarily Japanese event, into an international one, with many speakers attending from overseas.

I noticed many of the overseas speakers were hanging out with each other, or international residents like myself. While I appreciated the opportunity to get to know them, I also saw the divide between the global Ruby community and the Japanese one. I felt I was in a unique position to bridge the gap as a foreign developer living in Japan.

So after RubyKaigi, I launched [Tokyo Rubyist Meetup](https://trbmeetup.doorkeeper.jp), an event with the goal of bringing together Japanese Ruby developers and international Ruby developers. In addition to starting my own event, I wanted to make sure I was also an active participant in the existing Japanese community so I started attending a lot of [developer events in Tokyo](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/tech-meetups-in-tokyo), probably an average of one or two a week.

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdWxOIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--3e33405f146e289ec83fe14e6207f53c33048e65/Screenshot%202023-11-29%20at%2011.51.00.jpg" alt="My original blog"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;My original blog&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


As I attended some amazing events, I wanted the rest of the world to know what was happening in the Japanese community. So I started blogging about them on tokyodev.com.

## A fateful email

In August 2011, I received an email that started

&gt; I recently discovered Ruby on Rails, fell in love with it, and found your blog and your company website while looking for Ruby-related work opportunities in Japan. I just wanted to get in touch with you to introduce myself, learn about your personal journey in Japan, and see if you have any pointers for me towards starting my career in Japan. 

This was the first time I’d ever been contacted about the blog, so I was enthusiastic about being able to help someone who was just setting out on the same journey that I had taken. I started composing an email that got longer and longer. As I was writing my reply, I realized that the content of the email could be of use to others too, so I decided to post it as an article: [How I landed a software developer job in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/finding-a-job-as-a-ruby-developer-in-japan).

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdXBOIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--270124989384faec5e6f265525772545102f2df5/unnamed-5.png" alt="The article as it originally appeared"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;The article as it originally appeared&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

As far as I’m aware, it was the first English-language article on the topic, and so naturally it became the #1 result for queries like “software developer job in Japan”. This attracted more questions about finding a job as a developer here. To answer their questions, I wrote more articles in response, and things started to snowball from there.

## Starting a mailing list

Occasionally, I’d come across software developer positions in Japan that didn’t require any Japanese skills. These often weren’t being advertised anywhere, and I’d just hear about them due to being active in the community. So in October 2012, I started a mailing list to circulate information about those positions.

Over the next two years, I would send a total of twelve emails about job postings to the mailing list. By November 2014, it had accumulated 345 subscribers. While this is a meager number in internet terms, I'd already heard that several people had gotten jobs through it, so clearly it was making a difference.


## Commercializing the mailing list

When I’d started the mailing list, my motivation was to help people, and didn’t have any goal of building it into a business. But as I was hearing more success stories, I also learned that recruiters in Japan typically charge 30% of the new hire’s annual compensation. While the mailing list wasn’t exactly the same service, I was obviously leaving money on the table by not charging companies for it.

So I decided, why not pick up some of this “free money”? As long as I priced the mailing list in a way it wouldn’t deter companies from posting to it, I could still help developers as before. I decided the best way to do that was to follow the recruitment model, and charge a success based fee.

Because companies came via personal connections I’d made through things like networking events, though I made a simple contract, I relied on essentially the honor system. Candidates would apply directly to the company, and if they hired one of them, they’d let me know. And sure enough, it worked, with the first company posting to the list under the agreement making a successful hire.

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdXROIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--06b432c4179a27b7b4d7082bbf463c6d8a44046f/unnamed-6.png" alt="The original page advertising the service"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;The original page advertising the service&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

As I made more postings, companies who I didn’t have a connection to started to approach me on their own. Even though I had no personal connection with anyone at these companies, I still relied on the honor system and asked them to declare to me who they hired. When I tell people about this, they’re often incredulous that it worked, but this is one of the great things about doing business in Japan — you can count on your clients honoring agreements they make.

That’s not to say that there’s never been a case where a company has hired someone and not told me about it. When I’ve confronted them about it, the company will typically chock it up to a tracking problem on their end, and pay the fee owed. But these incidents were so rare, it wasn’t worth my time to put more safeguards in place.


## Transforming a mailing list into job board

By 2018, TokyoDev had gone from a mailing list with a few hundred subscribers to one with over five thousand subscribers. Additionally, I had gone from having so few jobs that I could only send an email every couple of months, to having so many jobs that I could send emails almost every week.

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdTVOIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--a84abe1c5b337abc515fa5b5850da5f982fe722b/unnamed-7.png" alt="TokyoDev as a job board first"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;TokyoDev as a job board first&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


The site was still primarily my personal blog, and the job listings were only available through the mailing list. Over time, readers pointed out some disadvantages of this approach, such as not being able to see past listings, or not being able to easily share listings with their friends. This led to me adding a “job board” section to my blog, where I’d list the positions that I posted to the mailing list, and later I worked with [a designer](https://www.mathieumayer.com) to relaunch the entire site around the job board.


## Becoming a “real” business

In 2019, TokyoDev became my largest source of income, eclipsing what I was earning from my main job. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why this was the year things took off, but I can point to a number of factors. 

First, at the end of 2018, I landed [Indeed](https://www.tokyodev.com/companies/indeed) as a client, after one of their engineering managers participated in [an event for CTOs I hosted](https://ctotalktokyo.doorkeeper.jp). Indeed had been making waves in the local tech scene for hiring large numbers of international developers and paying them well above market salaries that were more in line with US salaries than Japanese ones. Having Indeed as a client meant there was a recognizable name when other prospective clients came looking. 

Second, as it was now a job board as opposed to a mailing list for a semi-personal blog, I was operating and communicating as a business. This meant that other businesses, like Indeed, were more comfortable with me, and so it was easier for the various stakeholders to get on board.

Third, as I had been onboarding new clients with higher success fees, the average revenue per hire had significantly increased.

Fourth, one of the early startups that had used me was experiencing a lot of growth themselves, and so hired six or so developers that year via TokyoDev.

Finally, it was becoming increasingly common for Japanese startups to build up international engineering teams, and so the market as a whole had grown a lot since I had started the mailing list.

With the success I was having with TokyoDev, I decided to make it my primary focus, and moved on from my other job.


## The impact of COVID-19

In early 2020, as COVID-19 gripped the world, Japan basically halted the issuance of new visas. Many of the people hired through TokyoDev were overseas and looking to relocate to Japan, but this was no longer possible with Japan’s stricter immigration policies. Because I had been charging a success fee that was predicated on hires being able to get into the country, growth slowed, and in 2020 I only generated slightly more revenue than the year before.

But then TokyoDev experienced explosive growth in 2021 and 2022. Part of this was that all the hires that had been paused during 2020 were now able to enter the country, so I was able to receive the success fees for the last year. Another was a systemic change to how companies approached hiring globally.

Before COVID-19, almost all Japanese companies operated exclusively in person. That flipped during the pandemic, with almost all of them moving to be remote first. Whereas previously their hiring process defaulted to in-person, during the pandemic, everything moved online. This made it easier to accommodate overseas hires in the new standard way of doing things. What’s more, because Japanese companies were becoming more comfortable with remote work, companies could start hires on remote contracts while waiting for visas to be approved, which sped up hiring and onboarding, leading companies to be more willing to take a chance on someone overseas. 


## Expanding the business beyond myself

Since TokyoDev had almost no costs, virtually all the revenue it generated was essentially going into my own pocket. I wondered what I could accomplish if I reinvested the money in the business instead. I also felt a twinge of guilt that I was enriching only myself on the developers using my site.

In 2022, I decided to grow the business from just myself, to one that got other people involved on an ongoing basis. I now have six people working for TokyoDev on retainer contracts (no one beside me is full time though). 

One neat part of this is that TokyoDev itself has sponsored the working visa renewals for two of them, so I’ve had a first hand view of the process. It was quite easy for us to do, and I’ve been able to use my personal experience as a way of reassuring other companies that it isn’t something they need to worry about.

The TokyoDev blog has grown from having me as its sole contributor, to having eight other authors. This has allowed TokyoDev to highlight the experiences of developers beyond my own, and we now have articles from software developers on what it’s like working in Japan as [a woman](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/working-as-a-female-software-developer-in-japan), [as a Filipino](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/filipino-software-developers-in-japan), and as a person with [a disability](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/disabilities-in-japan-and-the-disability-certificate-shougaisha-techou). These authors have come from the Discord community, and being exposed to a diversity of perspectives has been one of the great benefits of it.

I’ve also started to sponsor developer communities in Japan ([particularly those that help women in technology](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/supporting-communities-women-technology)). These sort of communities are what inspired me to start TokyoDev in the first place, and so it’s been nice to have things come full circle and for me to be able to contribute back to the community that has helped TokyoDev grow.

From a purely business perspective, it’s hard to tell if these expenditures are causing TokyoDev to grow or become more profitable. As we approach the end of 2023, TokyoDev is in a similar place revenue-wise to last year. But in the last year, the US tech market has crashed, and while Japanese tech companies didn’t get hit as hard, the job market has [gotten more competitive](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/developer-job-market-in-japan-2023). So without this investment, perhaps we would have been in a worse place. 

However, from the perspective of our central mission, to help international developers start and grow their career in Japan, it has been without doubt a win.

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class="text-center"&gt;TokyoDev in its current incarnation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

## Why did TokyoDev work?

TokyoDev was by no means an overnight success. I’d already been blogging for five years before I even tried to commercialize the project, and it took another five years before I saw any significant return. This might seem like an eternity if my goal was to turn it into a business from the beginning, but because I didn’t have financial ambitions with it, it never felt like things were progressing too slowly with it.

But looking back over my story, it might seem like everything just fell into place, and that it was pure luck I could turn it into a successful business. There is one central thread I noticed though: my opportunities came from events, communities, and personal connections.

I posted about the events I attended to share them with the world. This led to personal connections with people who were interested in what it was like to be a developer in Japan, or how they too could become developers in Japan.

Through the events and communities I was a part of, I heard about  job postings that I never would have seen elsewhere, and were the source of my very first customers on the mailing list. People were willing to try posting jobs on my mailing list for a fee, and I was willing to trust them to tell me about their hires, all because we knew each other.

The next step into working with a major company like Indeed also came through an event. Making myself visible at events made that connection possible by putting me on the radar of someone at Indeed who had the power to take a chance with TokyoDev.

I hope this helps demonstrate the value of being an active part of communities where people help each other. TokyoDev’s central mission is also one of helping other people, and we have been growing a community that is helping more and more people all the time. Most recently, we have been focusing on growing [a community on Discord](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV) that has been successful in connecting both people outside and inside of Japan.

I’m excited to see where TokyoDev can go next.

    <content type="html">Even though I love Japan, I had never planned to work there. Like many Indonesian children, my first exposure to Japanese culture was through anime on Sunday morning TV broadcasts. At that time, I didn't even know it was called anime, let alone that it came from Japan since it was dubbed.

But as I grew, the more I realized that there are so many Japanese influences around me. Automobiles, music players, rice cookers. It is all imported from Japan. I enrolled in a vocational high school, and my school even provided a mandatory Japanese language class. 

I always thought that working in Japan would be very cool, but I didn’t make a concrete plan to work in Japan. 

So, how do I end up working here?

## Before Working in Japan

I was a CTO for a startup in Jakarta. We grew our team of engineers, but when COVID hit, it exposed that our business model wouldn't work well, so the higher-ups decided to pivot and work on something else. I decided to take a break and work on freelance software engineering projects. 

Six months in, one of my relatives was working for a Japanese company, and offered me a remote freelance job as a software engineer there. They focus on AR/VR/XR-related products like Apple Vision and HoloLens. They already had several key software engineers specialized in computer vision and needed someone who could work on their web-technology-related projects. 

It seems like a good fit. I said yes to my relative, and we set up a meeting with the company's owner. We discussed what kind of projects I would work on, the technology stacks, the deliverables, and our communication method. Everything clicked, and we started the freelance contract right away. 

I worked on several projects, and before long, I had been working for a year with the company. I was comfortable with their internal processes and getting along well with the other engineers. I even started working on my Master's degree during this time.

One afternoon, I took a break, ate my lunch, and watched YouTube videos. I got a Slack notification on my phone. I just finished a PR and figured they wanted to clarify some of the changes in my PR. I opened my phone, and I noticed it was from the CEO. It is not unusual that I received a message from the CEO, but not that happened so frequently either. Usually, it was when he asked for my input on a new project or for my opinion about potential partners in Indonesia. 

I opened the message, and it went roughly like this:

"We have been working together for around a year this month, right? And I believe you have started working on your Master's? Do you have any plans to work in Japan? "

It didn’t click right away where this conversation is going, so I just casually replied:

"Yeah, sure. But I don't have any concrete plan right now. Ideally, I would like to keep working while also doing my Master's degree, and I will think in more detail in the future… "

But then it hit me, and I quickly sent another message: 

"But if there is an opportunity, I would be very excited to take it."

## After the Offer

We set up a call to discuss the offer and flesh out the details. It was very casual, but at the same time, practically a job interview. So, I changed my usual conversational tone to a more professional one. At the end of the meeting, I said this is an exciting offer, but I will need to consider it. 

I tried to think about the offer more deeply, and three factors will affect my decision: the benefit of working abroad, the cost, and my family. 

Working in an international company, and even more so, actually working abroad, would be a very positive move for my career. Ideally, it would allow me to  explore many exciting career paths abroad. Even if it didn’t work out, and I needed to return to Indonesia, that additional experience would be attractive to recruiters in Indonesia. 

As I said, my knowledge of Japan was only about popular culture. I didn’t know what it would be like to live in Japan. Considering the living costs in Indonesia, I had a comfortable income from my freelance projects. I found resources online about living costs in Japan, and realized my new salary from the full-time contract would be enough to cover them. I couldn’t save as much as when I was living in Indonesia, but living in a country with a larger economy than my home country would provide the potential to increase my future income.

Lastly, I already had a family in Indonesia. My son was 6, and just getting ready to be enrolled in elementary school. If we all moved to Japan, he would need to attend an elementary school there. This was both exciting and scary for me. If I went abroad, I would really like to take my family with me, and especially show my son how people live in different places and expose him to  international culture. But I was also afraid he would not be able to adapt well to the Japanese school. I couldn’t afford to put my child in a Japanese International School, so our only option was the local Japanese school. My son was fluent in English and Indonesian, but he would need to learn Japanese at the local school. 

I asked my wife about her opinion and explained the details. She replied, "It would be stupid if you reject this offer."

I accepted the offer the next day. The first thing we did was prepare the papers and documents. He introduced me to a legal scrivener specializing in [Japanese working visas](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/japanese-engineering-visa-options), and we started the visa process. 

I submitted all the necessary documents for the visa application process, and the scrivener confirmed that everything was in order. However, due to the COVID-19 related border closure, the scrivener cautioned me that the visa processing might take longer than usual due. As a result, the scrivener suggested that I reach out to the Japanese embassy in Indonesia for further details and clarification.

I called the local embassy, and they told me the visa registration process was on hold, and to watch the news for the latest updates. In the meantime, the legal scrivener kept working on the CoE while waiting for the information on the border opening. 

The CoE was finished by November 2021, and I received the physical copy in December 2021. I waited another two months until the border was open, and the immigration process restarted at the end of February 2022. 

## First Few Months in Japan

By mid-2022, I had finally secured my apartment and flight ticket to Japan. It was an exciting and scary prospect, as it was the first time I was going to live abroad. Not to mention, I needed to be responsible for my family, too. 

I was under a housing program from my employer, where they handled all the contracts related to the apartment. By the time I arrived, I already had a key, and everything was already set up, like the electricity and gas. 

I spent more time in the office than before, and less on other activities like child-rearing and pursuing my degree. This was challenging, and I needed to be super disciplined to keep everything in check. This included staying healthy, since getting sick would take away precious time to do essential things. Also, I wanted to maintain a good appearance with the company, especially in the first few months. I considered myself a new employee under probation, even though I had been working with the company for over a year. 

One significant factor that boosted my confidence was that I had a relative who also lived in Japan, so if push came to shove, I could ask for their help. Luckily, there turned out to be nothing significant that would cause inconvenience for them though. 

After moving to Japan, the work hours and assignments did not change much, other than I now commute to the office regularly. I discussed this with the CEO, and we decided that I would go to the office two days a week in principle. I also only had a little overtime, which contrasts with a common stereotype in Indonesia: if you work for a Japanese company, you are expected to work crazy hours.

I used English with my immediate team in my daily work, while I used Japanese with the other employees. Most of the time, technical documentation came in Japanese, and I relied heavily on translator applications for complex explanations. Considering the language gap, I also clarified a lot with my fellow engineers to minimize misunderstandings. It helped that my coworkers were very supportive and respectful, which was a huge factor in my adapting in the first few months. 

Working for a small team, I had a lot of freedom in making engineering decisions. While the language was usually already decided since I was continuing existing projects, the library and tools I use were mostly up to me to decide. 

I had close to zero networks in Japan, so I started to get to know the local tech ecosystem by joining [meetups around Tokyo](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/tech-meetups-in-tokyo). Considering my limited Japanese, at that point, I only joined those arranged primarily by expats. I also discovered a small group of students who shared the same alma mater working and living around Tokyo, which helped building a network. 

Outside of work, I spent the first few months taking care of the documents at the local city office and elementary school, and getting used to the local dentist, post office, and doctors. Conversations with the regional offices were tough, and I relied heavily on the translator app. It helped that the people from the regional offices were very patient. I also found a local group organized by the city government and volunteers called [Yokohama International Lounge](https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/lang/residents/en/support/Internationallounge.html), which helps foreigners living in Yokohama, where I live. They provided:

* A general consultation service.
* Almost free Japanese language lessons.
* Regular events that mostly involved mothers and kids. 

I visited the local elementary school and felt very lucky that several faculty members were fluent in English, as my limited Japanese and translator app wouldn’t have been enough to bridge the communication otherwise. We are fortunate to live near such a school. Yokohama also provides a Japanese language learning program for children who just moved to Japan. All the support systems really relieved my stress and anxiety about navigating the beginning of my life in Japan. 

Living my whole life in a tropical country, I was not prepared to live in Japan. When I first arrived, it was summer, and slightly hotter than Indonesia. Still, it was something that I am familiar with and can bear. Closer to fall, the temperature and humidity dropped, and caused many problems for me. I have never experienced dry skin before, but now using moisturizer and lip balm was a must, or I will have a terrible day. 

Clothing was also something that I was not well prepared for. I visited the local Uniqlo to stock up on sweaters and heat tech for Fall and Winter. The first few weeks of fall were awful, especially when the temperature dropped under 15 degrees. But somehow, I could adapt well. It also helps to have an AC with a heater mode, which I just knew existed since I moved to Japan, and an electric blanket at the end of your day. By spring, I was already accustomed to the climate, and stocked with appropriate clothing. 

## What I Would Do Differently If I Had a Chance

Looking back, there are a few things that I could do better. My significant oversight was the language, especially related to my child. Having a support system from the local government and school was pure luck. 

When I chose an apartment to live in, I only cared about how close the local school was to the apartment. I brushed off other factors, assuming I could rely on my company and relatives if things get complicated. There was also a child-rearing subsidy from the government, which I discovered after I moved in. 

If I were to do it all over again, I would research what support is available from the municipal government before deciding on an apartment. In contrast, one of my friends from Indonesia who also moved to Japan a few months after I did was not so lucky. They also moved in as a family with children, but unfortunately their local government and city didn’t have much support for them. 

From a professional perspective, I would spend more time discussing the contract with my employer. I was also offered a housing program where my company would make the contract under their name, and I would have the rent deducted from my salary. In general, I received a lot of benefits from the agreement and the program my employer offered me. But given another chance, I would research more into the implications of the contracts and make a more informed decision before signing the offer. 

By now, most of my stress and anxiety about navigating life in Japan is gone. Work is progressing smoothly, while I continue to grow a  local network from local meetups and my alma mater. My child started to study at the local elementary school with great support from the school and local government, and my wife went to local events and made some friends she could rely on. It is not perfect, but somehow, it all worked well, and I couldn't be more grateful.</content>

    <title>The 2023 TokyoDev Developer Survey results are live!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/the-2023-tokyodev-developer-survey-results-are-live"/>
    <id>https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/the-2023-tokyodev-developer-survey-results-are-live</id>

    <updated>2023-11-27T10:05:00+09:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Paul McMahon</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">In October 2023, I conducted a survey of international developers living in Japan. The results are now live, please [check them out!](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US)

This year’s survey had a total of 713 respondents, up 28% from last year’s survey. This is an amazing number to me, as while it’s hard to say how many English-speaking international software developers live in Japan, I’d wager it is in the low tens of thousands, meaning our survey got at least 5% of them to respond.


## Median compensation was down

The median compensation of respondents was [¥8.5 million per year,](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/compensation/#current_total_annual_compensation) down ¥1 million from last year’s survey. 

One factor may be that respondents [tended to be less experienced](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#years_of_experience) than the previous year, having a median of 5 years professional experience, compared to last year’s median of 7 years. 

Another factor may be that there was a slight shift in the kind of companies respondents were working for. While in 2022, 26% of respondents worked for the Japanese subsidiary of an international company, [that dropped to 22%](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/employer-info/#current_employer) in this year’s survey. While this may not seem a significant difference, we also found that respondents working for such a subsidiary had a 73% higher median income than those working for a Japanese headquartered company.


## Higher unemployment and more job seekers

We conducted our 2022 survey just before the US tech market started to crash. While we haven’t seen the same degree of mass layoffs and hiring freezes in Japan, [it has gotten a lot more competitive](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/developer-job-market-in-japan-2023), particularly if you’re looking for positions that don’t require strong Japanese skills.

This increased competition was reflected in our results. [2.6% of respondents were unemployed](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/job-info/#employment_status), up from 0.5% in 2022, and [19% of respondents were actively looking for a job](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/job-info/#searching_for_job), up from 11% last year.


## Remote work on the decline

With the COVID pandemic, tech companies in Japan took a radical shift towards remote work, with it going from basically unheard of to almost universal. However, we’re seeing a move back towards the office. 

[While 70% of respondents](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/employer-info/#remote_work_policy) could work fully remotely in 2022, that dropped to 59% in this year's results. Furthermore, 9% of respondents were required to exclusively work from an office, up from 4% last year.


## Negotiating salary is more difficult with Japanese companies

Respondents who worked for a subsidiary of an international company were [more likely to be successful at negotiation](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/compensation/#negotiated_compensation). 36.6% of respondents working for an international subsidiary reported that they successfully negotiated, whereas 27.7% of those working for a Japan headquartered company did. For both company types, about 50% of respondents reported they didn't even attempt to negotiate.


## Women more likely to start a developer career in Japan

Irrespective of gender, respondents had [lived in Japan](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#years_in_japan) for a median of 5 years. While male respondents had a median of 8 years professional experience, female respondents had a median of 2 years. This implies that many of our male respondents started their developer career abroad, and then came to Japan after picking up some experience, whereas many female respondents came to Japan first, and then transitioned into software development.

A driver of women entering software development appears to be coding bootcamps. While 11.6% male of respondents had [graduated from a coding bootcamp](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#professional_qualifications), 35.5% of female respondents did.


## Plus so much more

Not only are there many more insights to be found in [the full survey results](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US), we’ve also added the ability for you to create your own custom charts, allowing you to explore the data further. So please dive in and take a look!</content>

    <title>My experience with Vulcanus in Japan, a training programme for EU engineering students</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">My journey in Japan started in a slightly unconventional way. While there are several paths to enter the country, such as a working holiday visa, English teaching, or getting hired by one of the [many wonderful companies](http://www.tokyodev.com/companies), posting jobs on TokyoDev, I first came here via the Vulcanus in Japan programme. More than just an internship, it’s a complete package including an intensive language course, cultural lectures and accommodation support. It can be an excellent starting point for engineering students who aspire to live and work in Japan in the future. So how exactly does it work, and what was my experience?

_Disclaimer: I joined the programme 4 years ago, and some of the contents described might have changed since then. Please consult [the official Vulcanus in Japan website](https://www.eu-japan.eu/events/vulcanus-japan) for up-to-date information._


## The Vulcanus Programme

Vulcanus in Japan is co-organized by the EU Commission and the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Every year, around 20 to 30 students are selected from a large pool of applicants to perform a technical internship in one of several Japanese hosting companies.

Not only that, but the programme also includes an intensive language course and multiple cultural lectures. Support is provided in all matters relating to setting up your life in Japan.

The application process begins with a pre-selection based on your resume, motivation letter and recommendation letters. Then, host companies get to take a look at the students and pick those that they believe are a good fit for their open internship positions. Thus, when applying, you need to appeal to both the programme committee, as well as the Japanese companies themselves. I wrote a more in-depth guide on how to improve your application [here](https://www.mariomeissner.dev/posts/vulcanus-in-japan-application).

Those selected then join an information session in Brussels, which provides participants the opportunity to get to know each other, while also getting briefed on the programme details. 


## The Language School

I arrived in Japan on September 1st, and after a few additional briefing sessions and administrative procedures (such as opening a bank account and obtaining a phone number), I settled in my little apartment in Yokosuka, Kanagawa, and was ready for 4 months of intensive language learning. I wrote more on my arrival experience [here](https://www.mariomeissner.dev/posts/vulcanus-in-japan-arrival) too.

The language school I attended was the [Naganuma School](https://www.naganuma-school.ac.jp) in Shibuya. I found their teaching approach very effective due to their strict policy of only using Japanese during the lecture, even at the very beginner levels. Additionally, I greatly appreciated the complementary excursions and cultural activities such as calligraphy and tea ceremony.

Before I arrived, I took a short test to assess my Japanese ability, and was assigned to a class of the appropriate level. While most students arrive with close to zero knowledge of Japanese, I  already had an intermediate level of Japanese on arrival, and had the chance to pick one of the advanced courses. I chose the business Japanese track, which turned out to be extremely useful, with topics such as handling telephone conversations, emails, and even work interviews in Japanese. It even covered behavioral lessons such as how to exchange business cards, or where to stand in the elevator (believe it or not, there’s rules for who stands where in many situations; _shimoza_ being the spot for the lowest rank person, and _kamiza_ for the highest).


## Internship Location

My host company was NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone), a major telecommunications company with research centers throughout Japan. Due to my background in machine learning, I was selected as an intern in the speech recognition team at their research center in Yokosuka.

Most interns will be located in Tokyo, but a few, such as me, will be positioned in slightly more remote locations such as Yokosuka, Tsukuba or Atsugi. Occasionally, there will even be positions in the Kansai region, such as Kyoto.

In my opinion, those kinds of locations are much more rewarding than Tokyo, since you get a chance to experience a more unique and traditional face of Japan that is not present in Tokyo. Nature is closer, trains are not so crowded, and the people are warmer and less busy. It is also more challenging to survive without Japanese, which gives you the necessary motivation to continue learning once the language course ends and your internship begins.


## Internship Experience

This is the part of the programme where students will have widely different experiences, both positive and negative. Some of the other participants I talked to complained that the company wasn’t a good match, did not care much about them, or had unexpected changes in their team or internship content. Most, however, had extremely fulfilling experiences, including myself. Additionally, many received full-time offers by their host companies upon completion of the internship, and at least a few students each year stay working full time. There were even instances of students releasing patents and research papers during the internship, marking an extremely successful end to their internships in Japan.

Personally, I improved my Japanese significantly while working at NTT, since all my colleagues were Japanese and I needed to communicate daily with them. I even had the opportunity to give presentations and receive feedback on my projects. While I didn’t stay at NTT (instead pursuing higher education in Tokyo), I am still in Japan 4 years later at the time of writing this post.


## Final Thoughts

Vulcanus in Japan is not for everyone. Firstly, the programme has strict eligibility requirements. You have to be an engineering student from a selected number of countries, and have completed at least 3 years of university education. Additionally, the monthly stipend is not very high, requiring a certain amount of discipline and strategy to survive. Finally, you need a bit of luck to be matched with a company that aligns with your expectations.

With all that said, if you are an adventurous European engineering student looking for a path to Japan, the Vulcanus programme might just be the opportunity you are looking for!</content>

    <content type="html">Intra-company transfers are a less-common way to move to Japan for work, but [Mary Grygjeanne Grace Icay](https://www.tokyodev.com/authors/mary-grygjeanne-grace-icay) (Gray in the [TokyoDev Discord community](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV)) managed to do it. She originally worked for a subsidiary of a Japanese company in the Philippines and was able to seize a transfer opportunity to move to Japan and start a new chapter of her life.

Grace spoke about some of the upsides, such the basic Japanese skills provided by her company, but also about some of the downsides, such as having to pay taxes in both Japan and the Philippines at once. A major upside for her as an international transferee was that the company handled everything related to visas and relocation for her, thereby lowering one of the highest hurdles many people face in moving to Japan.

We also spoke about cultural differences and stereotypes, and how even "good" stereotypes can be inaccurate or misleading, such as stereotypes of Filipino adaptability or Japanese organization and cleanliness. Unfortunately, she had a few stories about how these stereotypes surfaced in interviews and work environments – in some cases, even influencing her decision to continue interviewing with particular companies!

However, like many people, Grace sought higher-paying, longer-term employment in Japan for job security. She eventually [signed on at Yaraku as their first QA Engineer](https://www.tokyodev.com/companies/yaraku/interviews/mary-grygjeanne-grace-icay). We spent the final third of our conversation discussing Grace's experiences at Yaraku, which provides a Translation Management System application. One revelation was that despite the primary language at work being English, Grace has found that her Japanese language knowledge and experience since she came to Japan has proven invaluable for her as a QA Engineer there.

Grace also discusses her approaches to QA and ticketing, and what she looks for in a healthy work environment that supports its QA Engineers – but you'll have to watch to find out everything!

    <content type="html">At the beginning of the year, I bought a new M2 MacBook Air for ¥220,800 (about 1,500 USD) on Apple Japan’s online store. Thanks to me not bothering to set up Find My, it’s now a worthless brick. To add insult to injury, I had paid ¥77,619 (500 USD) to have said brick returned to me. Apple could theoretically unbrick it, but refuses to do so. Don’t make the same mistake I did, and make sure you turn on Find My.

## Swapping MacBooks at airport security

This all happened because I went through airport security. As one is required to do, I removed my Midnight Blue MacBook Air from my backpack, put it on a tray, and after it went through airport security, I picked it up again.

Or so I thought. About 30 minutes before my flight was boarding, I pulled out my laptop to do some last minute work. But when I opened it up, a stranger’s profile greeted me. Evidently we had swapped laptops going through security. So I raced back, and returned the stranger’s laptop, and explained the situation.

While security managed to identify the stranger’s flight, it had already taken off. I filled out the airport’s lost item form, and boarded the plane crestfallen. I hoped I’d recover the laptop, but to prepare for the worst, ordered another new MacBook using the plane’s wifi. I could always return it if my original MacBook was returned.

## An email from the United Arab Emirates

A bit over a week after I lost my MacBook, I received an email from someone in the United Arab Emirates saying they had my laptop and asking if I had theirs. I don’t know how they found me, but I told them I had returned theirs to airport security, and asked for mine back.

They agreed to send it back, but seemed a bit clueless as to how to return it. Part of this may have been because they didn’t have a fluent English ability. While it was a bit ambiguous to me who should be responsible for paying for the return from a moral perspective, it became clear the only way I’d get it back is if I ordered a courier to pick it for them.

There was a lot of back and forth between us. But after about a month after receiving the initial email from the stranger, a package arrived from the UAE. Getting it delivered was quite expensive. DHL ended up charging me ¥66,519, which was more than the initial estimate they gave me. I also needed to pay ¥11,100 of import duties on it - it didn’t seem to matter that the MacBook was mine.


## A box filled with exotic scents and crushed dreams

I eagerly opened the box, which had a distinctly exotic scent - perfume or spices, I couldn’t quite place it. Sure enough, there was a bubble wrapped Midnight Blue MacBook Air. Opening it up, there was a Japanese keyboard. Everything good so far.

Booting it up, something was a bit strange though. Rather than being greet by my login screen, I saw “Activate Mac”, and was prompted to select a wifi network. I did this, and then was shown an “Activation Lock” screen.

&gt; This Mac is linked to an Apple ID. Enter the Apple ID and password that was previously used with this Mac. p·····@icloud.com

Weird. My Apple ID uses my tokyodev.com email address, not an iCloud one. There was an option to “Use Device Password”.

&gt; Enter the password that was previously used to unlock this Mac.

I entered my password.

&gt; The operation couldn’t be completed. The password for this Mac can no longer be used to remove Activation Lock. The password was entered incorrectly too many times.

Uh oh. What do I do now, I thought to myself. Some searching brought up Apple’s documentation about [how to remove Activation Lock](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201441). 

&gt; If you need help removing Activation Lock and have proof of purchase documentation, you can start an Activation Lock support request.

I bought the MacBook from Apple, and so I thought this should be straightforward enough. I went through their support request form, attaching the invoice their online store gave me. Then I waited.


## Apple refuses to disable the Activation Lock for me

After two weeks of waiting, I got fed up, and contacted Apple’s normal support about it. Their support representative was able to confirm that I had submitted a request to disable the activation lock, but the team responsible for that had rejected my request the same day (but I didn’t receive any notification about it).

The support representative wanted to really make sure of everything, and included having them use remote access on my iPhone. They were surprised to see that the locked MacBook was showing up in my list of iCloud devices, but a different iCloud account was showing up on the unlock screen of the MacBook. Eventually, they concluded there might have been a problem with how I submitted the support request. It asked for the purchase date. I entered the 請求日 (invoice date) whereas they thought I should have entered the 注文日 (order date). These were both in the receipt, but whatever, I submitted another request.

Four days later I received an email about the first activation lock request.

&gt; We are unable to process your request at this time.

Ten days since I received that email, I still have not received any update on my second unlock request.


## How did it get locked in the first place?

It remains a mystery as to how the Activation Lock got activated in the first place. I have a couple of theories though.


### I set up Find My with an Apple ID that I don’t remember

That the iCloud address starts with a “p”, my first initial, is haunting me. Could it be that I somehow created an iCloud address when first setting up the MacBook? I certainly don’t remember doing this though. 

Furthermore, Apple ID requires you to have a phone number associated with the account, and only allows one phone number per account. My own phone number is already connected to my tokyodev.com account, so I would have needed to set it up with a different one, which seems impossible.


### The stranger wiped my MacBook, set it up for themselves, and turned on Find My

The stranger did take an awfully long time to return my MacBook. Maybe this was because they were using it for themselves until their own was returned. If I hadn’t set up Find My for the MacBook, they should have been able to wipe it themselves. When they set it up for themselves, they could have set up Find My, and now the Activation Lock would be enabled.

If they then reported the device as lost, Activation Lock should have been turned on. Furthermore, Apple explicitly states that they won’t remove the activation lock for devices in Lost Mode.

I suppose this is theoretically possible. I did ask them if they recognized the icloud address, but they didn’t. The only way this makes any sense is if they were being malicious, but I doubt that’s the case.


### There’s a bug with Activation Lock

Apple’s T2 Security Chip allows [a maximum of 90 unlock attempts](https://www.apple.com/mideast/mac/docs/Apple_T2_Security_Chip_Overview.pdf). If those attempts are exhausted, access to the disk should be unrecoverable, but it should be possible to wipe the MacBook by starting it in recovery mode. 

I tried doing this, but when doing so, I’m prompted to disable the Activation Lock. This is the expected behavior if Find My had been activated, but not if it wasn’t.

The stranger could have tried to brute force my password. Eventually they exhausted the unlock attempts. What if there’s a bug in this case, and somehow the system is prompting me to unlock it via a non-existent Apple ID. My username starts with a “p”, so I could theoretically see a programmer using a `username@icloud.com` address as a placeholder.

It seems unlikely that such a bug would slip through, but it is certainly possible. I’d love for someone at Apple to prove me wrong by explaining what actually happened.


## The problem with being too secure

I get why Apple doesn’t want to tell me why they’re rejecting my requests to disable the activation lock, as it would help an attacker figure out how they might get a stolen MacBook unlocked.

I also understand that they must receive a lot of requests in relation to MacBooks that people bought “used”, and so they want to minimize their time spent actually reviewing the requests.

But come on! I bought the MacBook from Apple. I’m clearly the owner. They presumably can see that my Apple ID is associated with it. The only case I can think of where they legitimately shouldn’t unlock it is if I sold it to someone else and then stole it back from them. 

With removing the Activation Lock, I could only wipe the MacBook anyways. There’s no one's data at stake. Surely in a case like this, it’s better to let me wipe it.

Simultaneously being this strict and allowing MacBooks to be set up without turning on Find My creates a channel for abuse. An attacker could “prank” someone by wiping their MacBook, activating it with their own Apple ID, and then reporting it as lost. The victim then has no way to recover it.

Since Apple isn’t able to handle legitimate requests to disable the Activation Lock like mine, you should turn on Find My on your own MacBook, or risk it becoming a brick like mine.</content>

    <content type="html">The 2023 edition of the TokyoDev Developer Survey [is now live](https://surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/survey/tokyodev/2023)! If you’re a software developer living in Japan, please help us by taking it.

[Last year’s survey](https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2022-developer-survey) got over 500 responses, and showed the average salaries of international developers living in Japan were at record highs. But with the tech downturn in the US, has this changed? Has the end of COVID restrictions meant tech companies here have been ditching remote work and returning to the office? 

With this year’s survey we hope to answer those questions and more by touching on topics like job satisfaction, technological choices, work environment.

The survey is anonymous, and we will only release aggregated data to avoid disclosing any personal information. The more responses we get, the more interesting insights we’ll be able to share, so please help out by [answering the survey](https://surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/survey/tokyodev/2023) and sharing it with your peers!</content>

    <content type="html">Writing a resume for your native language and culture is a sizable challenge for many, especially for software developers. The stakes are high (a job you want!), but the advice is uncountable and often contradictory. While many people may first think that it would be natural to submit a resume in Japanese to companies in Japan, the truth is that Japanese companies will sometimes write job descriptions in English—and when they do, that is a sign that you should submit a resume in English. Jobs listed on TokyoDev expect English resumes.

I have looked over pools of resumes when interviewing and hiring applicants here in Japan, and I was also an applicant myself just two years ago. So I have recent experience from both perspectives, as well as feedback from the many people who were kind enough to review my own resume while I was looking for a new job—all of that combined has resulted in my own set of advice about English resumes.

The [TokyoDev Discord community](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV) has a channel where community members submit their resumes for feedback and review. Many community members contribute their time and experience to help others improve their resumes.

This article covers pieces of advice that show up time and time again. From a high level, these are:

* [Include your basic information](#include-your-basic-information)
* [Use a common font in a readable size](#use-a-common-font-in-a-readable-size)
* [Use common section headings and formats](#use-common-section-headings-and-formats)
* [Use text, not graphics; be explicit](#use-text-not-graphics-be-explicit)
* [Use the keywords provided in the job description](#use-the-keywords-provided-in-the-job-description)
* [Use a spelling/grammar check tool](#use-a-spellinggrammar-check-tool)
* [Summarize experiences and achievements, not tasks](#summarize-experiences-and-achievements-not-tasks)
* [Be specific and add context](#be-specific-and-add-context)
* [Imagine what you bring to the role](#imagine-what-you-bring-to-the-role)
* [Add personal projects when relevant](#add-personal-projects-when-relevant)
* [Focus on content, not length](#focus-on-content-not-length)
* [Avoid including details that are too personal](#avoid-including-details-that-are-too-personal)
* [Concretely describe your Japanese ability](#concretely-describe-your-japanese-ability)

I sort this advice into two categories: optimizing for applicant tracking systems, and optimizing for humans.

## Optimizing for ATS

ATS, or Applicant Tracking Systems, are software suites that many companies use to streamline their hiring processes by extracting and normalizing information from resumes and applications. That normalized information is then stored to make it easier for recruiters to query, highlight, and visualize the way each applicant matches various positions.

Imagine that you are hiring for a single position and get 500 resumes on the first day. After reading through the first dozen resumes, you realize that most of them aren't even suited for the position you advertised. The thought of reading over 400 more resumes that may or may not even be relevant to the position you want to fill can be an extremely daunting task.

ATS scan resumes and extract keywords related to your roles, skillset, accomplishments, and educational background. If you present a resume that ATS cannot parse—for example, one written in crayon with pictograms—no matter how relevant your experience is, your resume may not even make it to human eyes for consideration. These extracted keywords can then be used in your profile in ATS to help people quickly understand your profile without having to pore over your full resume. But if ATS cannot parse your resume and fill out your profile, those reviewers may see a blank profile and drop you from consideration, rather than taking a deeper look at your resume.

Therefore, resumes should be written not only for humans, but also for automated scanning.


### Include your basic information

Your basic information includes things like your name, email address and perhaps your phone number (with country code). Make sure that these details are correct so that they can be captured—you don't want to miss a phone call for an interview because you mistyped your phone number!

When applying to jobs in Japan, it is also helpful to consider the employer's perspective and include your nationality, any Japanese residency status you may hold (and the term), any past time you have lived in Japan, as well as your Japanese language ability.


### Use a common font in a readable size

ATS will sometimes parse your resume using optical character recognition (OCR), which means that they look at your resume as an image and attempt to guess what the text is. Using a common font (e.g.: Arial, Calibri, Georgia, Times New Roman, Verdana) with a readable size (10-12 pt) reduces the chance of OCR errors that could result in your resume being filtered out.

Using a readable font size ensures that your resume is accessible for human reviewers as well.


### Use common section headings and formats

Avoid being unconventional. Using emoji or clever phrasing may stand out to human resume reviewers, but ATS will often not understand them, which may lead to it discarding or misfiling all information under that header. Label each section with commonly-used headers, such as "Work experience" or "Internships" instead of "💻🚀" or "My time before the grind".


### Use text, not graphics; be explicit

A popular resume format encourages people to list their skills with "skill bars" or icons. At first glance, it may seem visually pleasing, but it doesn't provide any useful information due to the lack of context. If someone has ★★★☆☆ in Ruby, does that mean that they're good, and ★★★★★ is the Platonic ideal of a Ruby developer? Or does it mean that they're average or below average? A job description will usually ask for "at least X years of experience", but neither ATS nor humans will understand how ★★★☆☆ relates to that.

Related to this, if you submit your resume as a PDF, do not rasterize your resume. Rasterization is essentially turning your PDF into an image, which makes your resume less parseable by ATS and less accessible for human reviewers. 


### Use the keywords provided in the job description

Job descriptions are like test cases: they provide the answers that they are expecting. If a job description seeks someone experienced with Django, but your resume mentions how you have contributed directly to Python and have worked with many RESTful frameworks, ATS may drop your resume due to not finding the word "Django".


### Use a spelling/grammar check tool

Both ATS and humans alike may drop a resume if it is riddled with misspellings, albeit for different reasons. Spelling and grammar check tools are ubiquitous and you should take advantage of them to prune all low hanging fruit. Perhaps you were tired when you wrote "prostgreasql", and you and other human readers may figure out that you meant "PostgreSQL", but ATS will not be able to parse your mistakes correctly.


## Optimizing for human readers

After your resume has passed the basic ATS-powered screening, its next stop will likely be a human being. There may even be multiple people reading your resume and leaving notes as they go through the resume pool and try to narrow it down to the interview candidates. There is no general way to know whether the person reading your resume will be technical or not, or what they value in a resume.

Fortunately, the tips meant for helping your resume pass through ATS filters will also help humans read your resume. This is not to say that we can't do even more to help your resume pass human screenings!

Context is important, so in the following examples, we will consider the following fictional job description:

&lt;div class="embedded-text" markdown="1"&gt;
**Senior Software Developer**

Fictional Ball Team is a semi-pro Japanese baseball team with an in-house engineering department that creates and maintains statistical software. Our coaches and front office use this software to collect and view statistics and notations that drive decisions around recruiting and training.

We are seeking an energetic, self-motivated senior software developer who can clean up our legacy application (written in Java) before we start building up a mobile application to replace it.

The mobile application and all legacy data will be deployed to managed devices, so you will be responsible for leading the development of those processes and infrastructure. We are seeking an engineer who is eager to lead a small team in taking responsibility for this product and the future mobile application.
  
**Required experience**: Java, Kotlin, JetBrains ecosystem, Android Studio  
**Nice-to-have experience**: Mobile app deployment to managed devices, mentorship, team leadership

&lt;/div&gt;

If you have that experience, your initial attempt at summing up your most recent role might look like this:

&lt;div class="embedded-text" markdown="1"&gt;
**Work Experience**

*Current Company, Senior Software Engineer (2020-present)*

* Maintained applications written in Java and Kotlin using JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, fixed bugs and released new features.
* Led a team of 4-5 developers in writing Android apps.
&lt;/div&gt;

Our fictional applicant hits many of the keywords highlighted in the original job description with this initial draft. It is typically unnecessary to call out tooling in your bullet points. However, since the job description specifically asks for someone with experience with specific tools, it can be smoother to work those tools into the bullet points than to create an entirely separate section for just one or two items.


### Summarize experiences and achievements, not tasks

A resume is generally understood to be a list of jobs/roles that you have held and "what you did at that job" in the form of a bullet point list. The previous example satisfies many of the criteria for passing ATS filters—note the keywords!—but may not be as effective for a human reader.

Almost every applicant who meets that job description is likely to have the exact same keywords. Your experience and accomplishments will make you stand out in the eyes of a human reviewer. A reviewer will have a list of questions, and ideally your resume will answer every single question so that the reviewer finishes and thinks, "This person is exactly what we need! Let's interview them!"

We can stand out from the crowd by adding more detail about our experience and what we achieved in a way that is more specific to the job description:

&lt;div class="embedded-text" markdown="1"&gt;
**Work Experience**

*Current Company, Senior Software Engineer (2020-present)*

* Maintained legacy desktop application MyApp in Java using JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA by fixing bugs, adding documentation, and increasing test coverage
* Led a small team to create a replacement mobile app MyApp2 in Kotlin and ensured smooth handover from MyApp to MyApp2
&lt;/div&gt;

### Be specific and add context

We can still improve those example bullet points by adding more detail and context. Many developers suffer from impostor syndrome, so what seems like "just a normal thing" could be impressive to other developers.

The caveat is that you need to know or be able to access the numbers you want to add. If your company tracks and generates statistics, you may find them useful for your resume as you work on it. It is also a good idea to keep a personal log of accomplishments to build your own dataset and remind yourself of what you have done after the days have blurred together.

It may be a simple query to find the number of times your product has been deployed or installed, but it may be tougher to understand how your changes have affected the product if you haven't kept a personal log.

Additionally, when possible, you can name other specific tools or goals to give context; "fixed bugs" isn't as meaningful as drilling down and calling out specific types of bugs, such as latency or crashes.

These details may be small, but they can give context to your accomplishments and make them resonate with the reviewer.

&lt;div class="embedded-text" markdown="1"&gt;
**Work Experience**

*Current Company, Senior Software Engineer (2020-present)*

* Maintained legacy desktop application MyApp in Java using JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA; reduced crash frequency by 80% and lowered latency by ~800 ms.
* Led team of five to develop mobile application MyApp2 in Kotlin to replace MyApp; created managed configurations for deploying to over 2,000 internally-managed devices.
* Mentored two junior engineers in achieving full test and Javadoc coverage with tooling such as the JavaDoc plugin for JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA and JaCoCo.
&lt;/div&gt;

### Imagine what you bring to the role

The job description is clear and lists several criteria, but perhaps there is more you can bring to the role beyond what is listed. It sounds like the company is going through a transition from an old product to a new product.

If you have experience with older software with an active user base that has reached the end of its lifetime, that is probably something worth going into detail about. Or perhaps you have helped write and scope tickets, or triaged feature requests—both of these are situations that are likely to come up in the situation outlined in the job description.

Given two candidates who seem equal in all technical aspects, the difference in the "out of scope" experience they have to offer will be one of the deciding factors. We can add a new bullet point for that:


&lt;div class="embedded-text" markdown="1"&gt;
* During MyApp2 development, evaluated the jobs-to-be-done by reviewing acceptance criteria and communicating with stakeholders to reduce scope or improve detail as necessary to ensure that the development team could deliver on expected timelines.
&lt;/div&gt;

This type of work is usually seen as product or project management work, but it is not uncommon for engineers to pick it up, especially in smaller teams. The job description called out that they are looking for someone to lead a small team, so it's a good bet that the reviewer will appreciate this detail.


### Add personal projects when relevant

Personal projects are another way of standing out from the applicant pool, but they should be relevant to the job at hand. Perhaps you have made a Notion clone or a to-do list manager, but unless there is something outstanding (e.g.: my to-do list app has 50,000 active users!), it probably isn't worth adding to your resume.

However, if the personal project is relevant, you might want to see if it's publicly available and is in a condition representative of how you normally write code. In this case, let's add a few related personal projects, which brings our extremely simplified resume draft to this:

&lt;div class="embedded-text" markdown="1"&gt;
**Work Experience**

*Current Company, Senior Software Engineer (2020-present)*

* Maintained legacy desktop application MyApp in Java using JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA; reduced crash frequency by 80% and lowered latency by ~800 ms.
* Led team of five to develop mobile application MyApp2 in Kotlin to replace MyApp; created managed configurations for deploying to over 2,000 internally-managed devices.
* Mentored two junior engineers in achieving full test and Javadoc coverage with tooling such as the JavaDoc plugin for JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA and JaCoCo.
* During MyApp2 development, evaluated the jobs-to-be-done by reviewing acceptance criteria and communicating with stakeholders to reduce scope or improve detail as necessary to ensure that the development team could deliver on expected timelines.

**Projects**

* BookSwap: In university, wrote and distributed an Android app to over 4,000 students to facilitate individual used textbook sales; maintained this app for three years until graduation.
* MySabermetrics: Wrote an API to extract US college baseball statistics from official sources in order to generate data and graphs per published information regarding PECOTA.
&lt;/div&gt;


### Focus on content, not length

A common worry for many people, especially for those in the early stages of their careers, is that their resume does not fit into one page. This is due to a general guideline that resumes should be one page.

Rather than focusing on the expected length of the resume, instead focus on filling your resume with meaningful content that applies to the job description. For example, after you've been in the workforce for a year or two, details about academic coursework in high school and university are less relevant and should be dropped.

If your resume is still longer than one page and contains only information relevant to the job description, then it is probably appropriate for the application; one exception would be a rare case where the system only accepts single-page documents or a specific number of words. In those cases, all you can do is sit down and start trimming older experience or compressing details.

Once you have passed five or so years of experience, you may even find that you struggle to fit your resume on even two pages, depending on the number and types of projects you have worked on. I have seen resumes from seniors that have been filled with three pages of extremely useful, pertinent information.

Let's introduce an artificial limit to see how this advice affects the example resume. What if the application form only allows 1,000 characters? Our working draft is a bit longer than that, so we need to trim some content to fit.

The most obvious candidate for removal is the BookSwap project. It is from the fictional candidate's university days, presumably more than at least five years ago as the candidate is applying for a senior position. The BookSwap project also duplicates more recent professional experience and is redundant. Although the candidate built BookSwap on their own and achieved a large user base, it is difficult to argue that it adds anything to the resume that doesn't already exist in a professional form.

We could also tighten up the resume by removing ambiguity. For example, the statement "reduced crash frequency by 80%" brings to mind a lot of questions—what was the crash frequency? Why was it crashing so much? Or if it wasn't crashing that much, does the percentage mean that the applicant caused it to crash one time less in a number of years?

If you choose not to remove this detail, you should be prepared to answer questions about it in an interview if the interviewer is curious. Another option would be to add more detail to the resume, but there isn't enough space to do that due to the 1,000 character limit.

A final option is to remove that statistic entirely, but review the issue to be able to present it in the interview if you are asked about an example of a specific bug you fixed. Not every story has to be in your resume.

## Avoid including details that are too personal

People often include details such as their photo, street address, race, age, gender, marital status, or religion. In some cultures, it may be common and accepted to include any of those details when applying for a job.

However, when applying for jobs in Japan, these types of details should not be included in an English resume. If a company requires any of that information, they will specify it in an application form. Providing that information up front in a resume potentially introduces bias.

Recruiters could act on that bias and discard the resume simply because the applicant is from a wealthy area or belongs to a specific religious group that they personally have distaste for. On the other side of the coin, because anyone acting on bias could open a legal can of worms, it is also possible that companies could discard your resume outright to prevent the possibility entirely.

Another angle to this problem is the issue of demonstrating a connection to Japan. When an applicant lives overseas, it's almost inevitable that an interviewer will ask "Why do you want to move to Japan?" This helps them gauge the level of commitment and make a guess about whether the applicant will be able to settle in productively. Companies do not want to invest time and money in securing a visa for someone who may decide after a few months that they want to return to their own country.

Many resumes I have seen include a section about interests or hobbies, which often mention something about video games, anime, food, or Japanese culture. Things like this can go either way for recruiters; some would see "anime" or "food" as unprofessional, but others would try to explore how that led to you deciding to move to Japan.

One strategy is to completely remove this information from your resume. While that may result in a more professional-looking resume, it may also weaken your resume in the eyes of some recruiters as you have no visible connection to Japan, and thus no visible reason to relocate or live in Japan.

If you choose to leave that information in your resume, it would be a good idea to prepare to speak about how your interests drove your decision to relocate to Japan in case it comes up in an interview.

## Concretely describe your Japanese ability

People often wonder how to express their Japanese language proficiency. Many naturally gravitate toward expressing it in terms of [Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/) levels, such as N1 (the highest) or N5 (the lowest), as that is one of the most common ways for foreign learners to grasp their capabilities.

The [Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR)](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions) is another scale people often use in their resumes.

However, both standards face the same problem: many Japanese people do not know about or understand what those scales are, which could result in your resume being filtered out by a busy person who doesn't have time to do research to understand what your grade means.

One of the simplest ways around this issue is to state your Japanese ability in simple, concrete terms. For example, you can say "Business level" or "Conversational" as shorthand. Interviewers often understand this problem and if you provide them with a basic idea of where you are, it is a prompt for them to engage you in Japanese, which can provide them with a more realistic view of your Japanese ability.

I have never taken the JLPT myself, which has at times invited questions about my actual Japanese ability vs my claimed Japanese ability. In the case of companies presenting their job descriptions in Japanese, one way I have sidestepped this issue in the past is by submitting my materials and application in Japanese. In that case, it is taken for granted that I can read, write, speak, and understand Japanese as the entire process is conducted in Japanese; any disfluency is immediately visible in the process itself.

Please note that this is not a strategy to use with companies posting their job descriptions in English; in these cases, if you submit a Japanese language resume, it may be discarded outright as the reviewer(s) may not even speak Japanese.

This is not to say that you shouldn't bother listing your certifications; if you have certifications showing your Japanese ability, such as the [Business Japanese Proficiency Test](https://www.kanken.or.jp/bjt/english/) (BJT), you can and should absolutely list them on your resume, but should also provide simple context because many reviewers will not know what the scores or grades mean. If you find that you are running out of space, a compact abbreviation such as "Conversational Japanese (JLPT N3)" gets the job done.

## Conclusion

While this article does not cover every possible scenario when writing a resume in English for submission to a company in Japan, it does cover many common issues I have seen in resumes presented in the [TokyoDev Discord community](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV). Having a peer review of your resume is an extremely important step; other people can help you understand what details or context you should add or remove.

    <content type="html">How do I get a job in Japan with no experience? Why are there no entry level jobs or ways to break into the industry?

This is one of the most common questions in the [TokyoDev Discord server](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV), and for good reason. The [job board](https://www.tokyodev.com/jobs) often only has positions for applicants at the mid-career (often starting at 3+ years of experience) or senior levels, with a dearth of positions for folks who have newly graduated or are changing careers.

One reason for this is that Japanese society (specifically, the hiring flow from university to a full time job after graduation) is structured in such a way that students are expected to hunt for jobs in their third year, while companies are expecting to hire fresh graduates. Due to this, in Japan, "entry level" jobs are often replaced with jobs for "new graduates" (新卒, shinsotsu).

This distinction may seem superficial, but the difference is that jobs for new graduates have specific requirements that the applicant has graduated from an educational institution within the last 1-2 years, and can also have unofficial age limits.

Given this, many people realize that a way to get a job in Japan is to go through the funnel as a university student and follow the normal flow to a first job, then gain experience.

This has some immediately obvious drawbacks:


* You probably need to be fairly fluent in either English or Japanese
* You need to be of the right age to enter university
    * Non-traditional students exist in Japan, but are an exception
* You need the finances to be able to travel to, live in, and go to university in Japan

[Lai Huynh Binh Minh](https://www.tokyodev.com/authors/lai-huynh-binh-minh) (Hinm on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV)) is one of the people who has traveled this path and has a full time job lined up at [Tokyo Techies](https://www.tokyotechies.com/) for after he graduates.

Minh was kind enough to give me over an hour of his time for this interview, where we discussed his decision to study overseas, what his university experience was like, the process of finding his internship, how he thinks about his role as an intern, and how he fits into the international culture at his company.

One surprising thing to come out early in this interview was that Minh's initial aim was to study psychology in the Netherlands – something that seems completely unrelated to working with software in Japan!

Unfortunately, we had some technical issues toward the end of the video (01:12–01:13) that distorted Minh's audio for about a minute. After that segment, the audio returns to normal.

This interview should be interesting not only for people considering Japanese universities and internships, but for developers and managers at all levels.

    <content type="html">Hi there!  I am Luke Wilson, a veteran Tech Recruiter with over 15 years of experience in the Japan market.  My recruitment career has taken me across both agency and in-house roles, with the most recent one being at [Indeed](https://www.tokyodev.com/companies/indeed) (a proud client of TokyoDev).

Over the course of my career I’ve had a lot of time to reflect on an important yet often neglected aspect of recruitment: **candidate experience**. Offering a great candidate experience will not only help you close the most desirable candidates, but also lead to interviewees giving referrals to your positions. Conversely, a poor candidate experience will cause candidates to drop out, and might even cause them to share their poor experience online, which could deter future candidates from applying.

I’ve seen this play out time and time again. For instance, in one case, a front end developer was interviewing with several firms in Tokyo. To him, most interview processes felt like factory lines, with disinterested interviewers who had not read his resume, moving at a sluggish pace, and demanding significant time investments for assignments irrelevant to the actual day-to-day job. One company was different though. They offered a streamlined interviewing process where they continuously sold the role to the candidate. There was nothing burdensome about the process, it was friendly and transparent. So much so that the candidate introduced his family to the boss in the offer meeting. Naturally, the candidate went with this company over the other ones.

Over the years, I’ve collected many strategies that help improve candidate experience. This guide will explore them, giving practical examples you can implement today at no extra cost.

## Turn Every Interaction Into a Thoughtful Touchpoints

The overall candidate experience is the sum of all the various pieces involved from initial contact to employment offer. Each step and touchpoint matters. Ensure that every interaction exudes consideration and respect. From responsive communication to accommodating special cases, treating candidates like valued individuals sets the tone for a positive experience.

### Personalise Communication 

Tailor your initial outreach to each candidate. Reference specific aspects of their CV or LinkedIn profile to show genuine interest and that you’ve done your homework.

### Be Open and Transparent

Be open and transparent about the positives and the challenges for the role. Be upfront about the salary range. Share the LinkedIn profile of the interviewers ahead of time to remove any guessing game, and put candidates at ease.

## Empower Candidates By Putting Them in the Driver's Seat

Empowering candidates in the interview process entails giving them a sense of control, respect, and involvement. By providing candidates with opportunities to assess the people on the other side of the interviewing table, you create a positive experience that fosters enthusiasm and mutual understanding.

### Share Interview Preparation Material

Share interview preparation material either via a brief prep-call with the TA, or a PDF _specific_ to the type of role they are interviewing for. Ideas of what to include might be description of the interview format, topics to cover, what signals the interviewers are _specifically_ assessing, hints on preparation (such as links to resources).  Refrain from sharing reading material that is irrelevant to their particular process.

### Give Candidates a Range of Interview Time Slots

Allow candidates to choose from a range of interview time slots. This acknowledges their busy schedules and demonstrates your willingness to accommodate their needs.

## Create a Peak Memorable Experience

Strive for excellence in every interaction and create memorable moments that resonate, leaving a lasting positive impression. Unexpected gestures, and small touches can make a significant impact.

### Send Company Swag

Sending company swag after the first interview regardless of outcome, will help candidates have a tangible memory long after the process is over.

### Give a Virtual Office Tour

Offer candidates a virtual tour of your office space as part of one of your interviews. This will showcase the company culture and work environment. If your firm is completely remote, ask would-be team-mates to join one of the interviews just for a few minutes to say “hi” and have a bit of friendly conversation.

## Set Clear Expectations to Avoid Dissonance

Uncertainty breeds frustration. From the outset, state clear expectations for the recruitment process, timeline, and feedback. By doing so, you mitigate the potential for dissonance and keep candidates engaged and informed throughout their journey. 

### Hold Yourself Accountable for the Expectations You Set

Hold yourself accountable for the expectations you set, and measure whether you are meeting them. For example, track the time it takes for candidates to move through the stages in your process, and the feedback turnaround time. Ensure these timelines match what you initially communicated with the candidate.

### Handle Changes With Grace 

Occasionally some candidates will need additional steps, or interviewers will suddenly need to cancel to put out a production fire. But are you being empathetic enough to the candidate in the way you make a change, and could you have a substitute interviewer ready to go so that the interview timeline doesn’t extend?

## Create Positive Endings Regardless of Outcome

Even if a candidate doesn't make it through the interview process, ensure the experience ends on a positive note. A courteous and respectful conclusion can leave a lasting impression. Candidates who feel valued, even in rejection, are more likely to speak positively about your brand, potentially leading to referrals and positive word-of-mouth. 

### Send Thoughtful Rejection Letters

Craft rejection emails that convey appreciation for the candidate's time and effort, while also providing constructive feedback for improvement.

### Provide Networking Opportunities 

Invite unsuccessful candidates to join your talent community or attend company meetup events, fostering a sense of connection and continued engagement.

## Solicit Candidate Feedback

Feedback is a valuable tool for growth. Actively seek input from candidates about their experience. What went well? What could be improved? Listening to their insights not only shows your commitment to improvement but also provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of your process.  

WARNING: Only ask for interview process feedback if it is your policy to share candidate feedback. Considering the amount of time candidates spend preparing, as well as the stress of the interviews themselves, it will feel like a double standard if you ask for feedback but don’t give it.

### Send Post-Interview Surveys 

Send candidates a _brief_ survey after interviews to gather feedback on their experience, your communication, and their overall satisfaction.

### Conduct Feedback Workshops 

Organise internal workshops or focus groups with past candidates that made it into the team to discuss their recruitment journey and brainstorm ideas for improvement.

## Sell Candidates on the Role

Remember, you're not just assessing candidates – they're evaluating you too. Present the role as an exciting opportunity, highlighting the company's culture, growth prospects, and unique offerings. When candidates see the value in what you're offering, they'll be more motivated to become a part of your team.

### Share Day-in-the-Life Stories

Share stories from current employees about their typical workday, challenges, successes, and growth within the company.

### Tailor Your Pitch to the Candidate

Each candidate is unique, so figure out what is important to every individual, and discuss why your role will satisfy their particular desires.

## Put Yourself in the Candidate’s Shoes

At the heart of it all, the candidate is the focal point. It is important to put yourself in their shoes, listen actively, and ask yourself whether your process makes them feel valued. Prioritising their experience ensures a mutually beneficial engagement that sets the tone for a productive partnership.

### Test Your Career Page

Testing out your own career page, to see what little steps are tedious and redundant. The fewer the clicks and manual data entry the better.

### Look for Unconscious Bias

Reviewing whether or not unconscious bias is seeping into the process. Each step should be consistent and fair for the people spending their time to interview with you.

## Conclusion

On to the elephant in the room…so why do we fail at candidate experience so often?! (including myself on occasion 🙁) And what are the trade-offs for the team executing the sorts of items mentioned in this guide?

It is not always easy to implement the above and there will be outright barriers preventing you.

You could be under-resourced and simply cannot spare the time as you grind through screening hundreds of CVs, while juggling dozens of potentials in the candidate pipeline.  Maybe there isn’t yet a culture of recruitment within the hiring team, thus causing drag to timelines as well as the quality of experience.  Perhaps communication needs to improve between the individuals directly and indirectly bottlenecking the various stages of the candidate journey.  It is possible there’s an element of “it’s always been done this way” and a strategic review is needed by leaders not involved in the day to day execution (the grind can make you blind, so fresh eyes help).

Offering a stellar candidate experience obviously requires more time and resources. But I believe it is a worthwhile investment, as a good candidate experience will not only help you close more and better candidates, but also cultivate a positive employer brand.</content>

    <content type="html">Working in a fast-paced environment such as tech, combined with moving to a homogenous country as a foreigner (such as Japan where standing out is not considered to be an exceptionally good thing) understandably takes a toll on someone’s mental health. At the same time, language and cultural barriers can make it harder to get proper treatment here.

I personally have gone through the mental health support system here, and though navigating it was challenging, going through it has put me in a better situation.

I’ve written this article to give people a better idea of the challenges they may face, and the available resources. It covers the following sections:

* [My Personal Journey with Mental Health in Japan](#my-personal-journey-with-mental-health-in-japan)
* [Mental Health Challenges Faced by Foreign Workers in Tech](#mental-health-challenges-faced-by-foreign-workers-in-tech)

## My Personal Journey with Mental Health in Japan

The state of mental health in a lot of countries (particularly Asian countries) seems bleak.

Growing up in the Philippines, I had no idea about the actual implications of having mental health problems. I grew up hearing that those who claim to be depressed are only saying so because they're bored or are attention-seeking.

What's even worse is that in high school, when I shared with some older peers that I was somehow struggling with my emotions and might have anxiety and/or depression, they told me that I'm being brainwashed by the media and that I'm too young to experience any form of depression or anxiety because I've never experienced what "real life" is like. That it's all because of people's obsession with labeling everything, and that it's just a fad that will probably disappear soon.

From someone who was struggling a lot with all these pent-up frustrations and mixed feelings, I was told that "Mental Health problems are only for those who can afford a therapist. For us who is just one hospitalization away from bankruptcy, we just have to suck it up". So like every older person who I asked, I chose to suck it up and proceeded with life as everyone knew it.

But navigating life as an adolescent in a new country with a completely different culture became a trigger for me to confront my situation head-on.

I moved to Japan at the age of 22, not knowing anyone when I came here. For the first 4 months of moving here, I had no one I could really talk to and always felt like I was alone in whatever I was going through. Working in tech most especially made me feel like I couldn't easily make friends outside of my work place.

As I grew older, I found it harder to focus on one thing for a long time and also had a hard time retaining information from new lessons (whether they be on Japanese or technology). I suspected something was going on, so I tried to ask my doctor if their clinic was able to diagnose if I had Adult ADHD (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) or some other kind of condition, but he told me that it's impossible for me to have seeing as it should have manifested in the form of being "disruptive" when I was younger.

Last year, on January 2022, I decided to start consulting a counselor regarding my problems. Then after a few sessions and understanding that maybe I need further help, I asked an HR personnel for help to look for clinics. I felt shame and fear that I may be judged, but they were very supportive and were able to help me get in touch with a psychosomatic doctor. Since then I've been taking medication to help with my symptoms.

It was a small change that I didn't know I needed in my life. Even my long-time friends have noticed the big improvement in my mood and behavior. But maybe if I didn't have such a supportive friend circle, I wouldn't have tried to seek help.

## Mental Health Challenges Faced by Foreign Workers in Tech 

According to BIMA’s Tech Inclusivity &amp; Diversity Report, [52% of tech workers](https://101datasolutions.co.uk/tech-workers-are-5x-more-likely-to-be-depressed-its-time-to-make-mental-health-a-priority-in-our-industry/) have suffered from anxiety or depression.

In foreigners working in tech and then moving to a new country more specifically, their mental health may be in a more vulnerable state. Possible reasons are:

- Isolation
    - Separation from loved ones or trusted people
    - Not having a sense of community that you can reach out to, especially if you’re living here  as a sexual or racial minority
    - Adjusting to a new environment/society
    - Language Barrier
    - Cultural Barrier
- Sedentary Lifestyle
    - Most tech jobs function like regular 9-to-6 office jobs, wherein there's not a lot of opportunities to meet new people and you're always facing your computer
- Constantly having to catch up with the rapid pace of technology
    - Burnout
    - Increase in Complexity of Work
    - Stress
    - Pressure (from bosses, peers, or even from yourself)

The pandemic that brought about new technologies and more cases of physical and social isolation have also heightened the issues that foreign software developers experienced in Japan. From lack of emotional and financial support to being afraid of being shunned by their employers, tackling with mental health problems while having to work everyday as if nothing is wrong is an entirely different beast in it of itself.

According to a survey by AppDynamics, "[Eight in 10 technologists](https://www.appdynamics.com/resources/reports/rise-of-full-stack-observability) say their job became more complex during 2020, a consequence of quick innovation and a sprawling technology stack".

## The Japanese Mental Health Support System

Just like a lot of Asian countries, discussions on mental health in Japan is taboo. There was (and  still is) a fascination for character tropes or subcultures like [Menhera-chan](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2022.737761/full) within the manga and anime circles starting a while back, but that does not consequently mean that there is a wider and better reception of mental health topics.

It takes a while for changes in societal views to take root in a place, especially with the older generation having this perception of how things are and how they should be. But as it looks like, things are beginning to [slowly change for the better](https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/mindful-care-changing-the-perception-of-mental-health-in-japan) and the stigma of going to a mental health care provider is starting to go away.

In Japan, mental health care is generally divided into [three groups](https://japanhealthinfo.com/mental-health/) -- Psychiatrists, who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of various mental health conditions; Psychosomatic Medicine Doctors, who treat physical problems caused by psychological stress (e.g. insomnia); and Clinical Psychologists, who perform psychological tests and face-to-face counseling services, but not prescribe medication.

There are only a few facilities in Japan that offer healthcare in foreign languages, and clinics offering mental health advice in multiple languages are even scarcer. Although clinics like [Yotsuya Yui Clinic](https://yotsuya-yui.jp/medicalE.html) in Shinjuku and [PSI Clinic](https://www.psim.cc/en.html) in Ginza are offering English support for their services, it's difficult to find clinics in areas outside of Tokyo, where lots of foreign residents are also residing. Getting an interpreter who can help with translating necessary information is a great need for most clinics, but most of the time, it's more likely that the foreign patient will be the one to carry the burden of the costs of paying for the interpreter.

Access to medical help is generally difficult for foreigners living in Japan due to the language barrier, but differences in culture could further become a barrier in proper diagnosis of the patient. "People describe their symptoms in different ways according to their culture. Although it has become common in the West for people to say they feel depressed… residents of Asian and African countries are more likely to describe their symptoms in terms of physical complaints like headaches, stomachaches, or a lump in the throat." Taisho University professor Ukawa Ko explains.

To add to this, neurodivergence doesn't look like it's a well-known topic in the country.

According to [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23154-neurodivergent), the term “neurodivergent” describes "people whose brain differences affect how their brain works. That means they have different strengths and challenges from people whose brains don’t have those differences. The possible differences include medical disorders, learning disabilities and other conditions."

I know some people living outside Japan who have been diagnosed with Adult ADHD and also found [this study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796857) on the increase of diagnoses for ADHD in adults within Japan.

Looking into it further, I found out that Adult ADHD mostly goes undiagnosed in Japan and doctors only prescribe medication to those who have been previously diagnosed (as children or as adults, from another country). You have to bring proof of your diagnosis for the clinic to get a prescription as well.

Furthermore, despite being diagnosed previously with a type of mental health problem that requires medication with stimulants, it is quite difficult to obtain this type of medication in Japan, as all medications containing stimulants are prohibited in the country. This includes Adderall which is a standard medication used to treat ADHD symptoms in the USA. Adderall contains amphetamine, which is a [strictly controlled substance in Japan.](https://www.kansaigaidai.ac.jp/asp/pre-arrival/orientation-program/bank/user-guide/)

[Accredited clinics](https://www.fukushi.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/shougai/shougai_shisaku/hattatsushougai.files/200420-9.iryoukikan-list.pdf) need to issue a license to prove that you're allowed to take the medication containing stimulants, and even then, the pharmacy that you're buying the medication from also needs to have the license to sell the medication.

Japan could still use a lot of improvements on developing a more [multicultural healthcare system](https://www.nippon.com/en/currents/d00449/) that could help address the needs of its growing foreign resident population.

## Improvements To Japan’s Mental Health Care System

Aside from the Japanese government, some NGOs and private practitioners are also working towards being able to provide a more robust mental health care system not only for Japanese professionals, but for foreign nationals working and living in Japan as well.

But what can we, as individuals, do to help?

1. Normalize talking about it. Create an open space for discussion and help reduce the stigma surrounding mental health.
2. Mindfulness. Recognize the signs of a mental health crisis, and be able to identify when you or other people around you are suffering from mental health crisis so that you may seek for guidance from the appropriate people
3. Help spread resources and awareness. Japan has health care providers and support groups, but not all of them are easily accessible to everyone.
4. Support national or international initiatives in order to de-stigmatize mental health.

I'm not sure if it's just a Filipino thing, but most people I know would never go to the doctor unless their symptoms are so bad that they can't physically take it anymore. It shouldn't be like that for anyone. Once you feel some symptoms, it's better to have it checked by a qualified professional and get diagnosis.

As an employee, mental health care is also part of your compensation (it's covered under most, if not all Japanese health insurance providers), so be sure to make use of these benefits and seek help if you need it.

## Mental Health Resources for English Speakers in Japan

If you or someone you know needs mental health resources, please help refer them to the following resources so that they can get the help that they need.

- [TELL JP](https://telljp.com/)
- [Tokyo Counseling Services](https://www.tokyocounseling.com/en)
- [Japan Health Info](https://japanhealthinfo.com/mental-health/)
- [International Mental Health Professionals Japan - Guide for Finding a Therapist](https://www.imhpj.org/find-a-therapist-guide/)
- [Stonewall Japan](https://stonewalljapan.org/resources/mental-health/)
- [Tokyo Mental Health](https://www.tokyomentalhealth.com/)

## Final Words

Mental health care is not a one-size fits all solution--each person may require mental health support under a generalized umbrella of terminology, but it still depends on a case-by-case basis on how the person should be treated.

Everyone is struggling through their own battles, so always choose to be kind.</content>

    <content type="html">Now that you’re in Tokyo looking to start or further your IT career, you might want to look into attending tech meetups.

Tech meetups are events held online and offline, and attending them is a great way to form connections and establish yourself in the tech community. It could even lead to your next job!

## Common Types of Tech Meetups

Below are some of the common formats for tech meetups in Japan. Sometimes an event will be a mix, i.e. starting out with lightning talks, and leaving time for networking at the end.

### Networking

Networking can sound like a scary word, but a typical networking meetup is just having friendly, unorganised chats with other developers and tech-adjacent people, over some food and drink. There’s no set agenda or schedule — it’s just about turning up and connecting with others.

### Lecture-style

Lecture-style meetups involve participants listening to a speaker (or speakers) share their expertise. This could be a presentation or interview with an expert, lightning talks from members of the community or a discussion delivered by a panel. It’s common for these events to be broadcast online.

### Group Study

Group study meetups, also known as *mokumokukai* ([もくもく会](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%82%82%E3%81%8F%E3%82%82%E3%81%8F%E4%BC%9A)) or *benkyoukai* (勉強会, *study meeting*), are intended for people to study their own topic-related materials together. By studying together around a theme, participants can easily consult with each other. *Mokumokukai* are held both online and offline, and usually have a schedule of introductions, study time, and then an optional review of what you worked on.

### Workshop/Hackathon

Workshops/hackathons involve hands-on participation and give attendees a common goal to work towards. These events are a good opportunity to gain experience or knowledge, and because everyone is working closely together it’s easy to communicate with other participants and form connections.

## Differences Between Japanese and English Tech Meetups

On the whole, Japanese and English tech meetups are pretty similar — developers and technology-adjacent people get together and enjoy an event. However there are differences, some which you might not be expecting.

### Language Barrier

Typically people will use the language the event was advertised in. This means that even though we are in Japan, English meetups will attract mainly English speakers and people who want to practise English. If you want to make use of your Japanese skills, you should look at Japanese meetups.

Conversational Japanese will let you get by at networking events, but being able to talk about technology and code will help you better connect with other developers. A lot of Japanese tech vocabulary sounds similar to English! However, if you’re listening to talks or a panel, conversational Japanese might not be enough to follow a technical presentation delivered at native-speaker speed.

### Afterparty Culture

In Japanese there is a word, *nijikai* ([二次会](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BA%8C%E6%AC%A1%E4%BC%9A)), which means second party or after party. This is a casual hang out after the event where people socialise and it’s usually accompanied by alcohol. While people at English meetups seem to chat a lot during the event itself, at non-networking Japanese meetups everyone seems to be very focused on the meetup, and save the socialisation for afterwards.

If you want to get more involved with the Japanese tech community, try to plan ahead so that you also have time to attend these after-events. And if alcohol isn’t your preference, don’t force yourself to drink — soft drinks and tea are available, and are now considered an acceptable choice.

### Use of Social Media

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/) (X) still remains the SNS of choice for Japanese meetups, despite having lost a lot of its popularity among English speakers. (Within English speaking tech circles [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) seems to be gaining popularity instead.)

Often Japanese event details will include a specific hashtag, allowing attendees and presenters to easily interact with each other on Twitter. It’s not uncommon to see attendees live tweeting these events — without any images. That doesn’t mean you can’t take photos, just check beforehand if it’s ok, as some events/venues don’t allow posting to social media.

## Where To Find Tech Meetups

One option is just to type into Google ‘Tech Meetups in Tokyo’ or ‘エンジニアのイベント’ (*events for engineers*). Joining online developer communities, such as the [TokyoDev discord](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV) or [HNTokyo slack](https://hntokyo.io/en/pages/community/), can also help keep you up to date on what's happening.

However, if you want to check out more specific resources, the following websites are all used by various groups to schedule and advertise their events. You can find groups that interest you, follow them, and then receive updates when they have a new event.

### Meetup

[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/home/) is where you can find a lot of English speaking tech meetups, just set your location and search for what you’re into. The site is used globally to organise meetups, and has not just tech related events but basically whatever people are into.

### Doorkeeper [Doorkeeper](https://www.doorkeeper.jp/?locale=en) contains a mix of English and Japanese tech meetups, and also other non-tech-related events. It was built for Japan, and the interface comes in English and Japanese — just specify the prefecture and you’re good to go.

### connpass

[connpass](https://connpass.com/) features IT meetups held in Japan, and despite the interface containing English, the meetups are mainly in Japanese. If you connect your SNS account, you can share with your friends which events you are planning to attend and vice versa.

### TECH PLAY

[TECH PLAY](https://techplay.jp/) aggregates information about Japanese IT events from Connpass and Doorkeeper, as well as allowing groups to publish events directly. The interface is all in Japanese, but meetups are tagged with relevant technologies and themes, making them easy to search for.

### peatix

[peatix](https://peatix.com/) has a variety of events in both Japanese and English. The interface is a mix of the two languages, but you can easily search for tech meetups by specifying the location and choosing テクノロジー／サイエンス (*Technology / Science*) from the dropdown.

## Attending Your First Tech Meetup

Meetups can be daunting, but they’re a lot of fun and there are many benefits. You can learn more about current technologies, what people are working on, and what companies are operating in the space. Sometimes there will even be food and drinks, or sponsored swag.

Lecture-style or group study events are great if you’re nervous about meeting strangers. Since there’s something to focus on, the bar for participation is lower, but you still get to meet and interact with other developers.

If networking is your goal, be willing to start conversations and engage with others. Ideally someone will come and chat with you, but there’s no guarantee of that, so you have to be ready to be the one to approach people. It might help you to go with a friend, then at least instead of wallflowering you can talk to each other. 

It’s important to remember that everyone there also wants to make connections, they’re not going to shut you down for saying hi. 

So why not try attending some tech meetups in Tokyo!

## Introducing Some Tokyo-based Tech Meetups

Below are some of the regular tech meetups I’ve been to. I’ve included a short description and the type of developer I think would enjoy attending them.

### English Meetups

#### [HN Tokyo](https://hntokyo.doorkeeper.jp/)

*“Tokyo's longest-running hacker networking event. Come on out and meet other entrepreneurs, startup founders, and technologists.”*

HN Tokyo’s meetup is held at Shibuya, and a great place to meet other technology-related people. It’s a pure networking event (with some time set aside for announcements), so it’s best suited for people who have the energy to enjoy meeting and chatting with friends-to-be.

I introduced myself in the slack community with some [art](https://twitter.com/mishmashtan/status/1593060218568847362?s=20) I drew and people were like ‘oh hey! I know you! You can draw! This is Michelle, she drew something cool!’ which was a really nice icebreaker. I met some really awesome people here, including TokyoDev’s founder, [Paul](https://www.tokyodev.com/authors/paul-mcmahon). Everyone has different backgrounds and experiences, and it’s nice to be able to chat and learn from such a variety of people.

#### [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/)

*“TokyoDev helps international software developers start and grow their career in Japan.”*

TokyoDev hosts semi-regular casual meetups for international developers living in Japan to meet and chat. The events are announced in the TokyoDev discord and anyone in the community is welcome to come.

For me, the fun part is seeing in-person people you usually only chat to online. It’s also a great opportunity to get a developer’s viewpoint on how things work at different companies, and discuss with developers how things should be built. The events have had a good gender mix so far, and we often go for *nijikai* after the event.

#### [Tokyo Rubyist Meetup](https://trbmeetup.doorkeeper.jp/)

*“Tokyo Rubyist Meetup (trbmeetup) is an event that seeks to help bridge the Japan and international Ruby and Ruby on Rails community.”*

TRBMeetup hosts an in-person event “whenever people volunteer to speak”, or about every three months. It’s a great event for people interested in Ruby or Ruby on Rails, regardless of experience level. Despite it being an English speaking meetup, Japanese developers join as well.

I only just started my Ruby journey a short while ago, but the talks have been accessible and the other attendees are super friendly and helpful. There’s a small fee to attend, which gives you access to networking, talks, and a delicious mostly-vegan dinner.

#### [Tokyo .NET Developers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/tokyo-net-developers-meetup/)

*“Meet other developers in Tokyo that use .NET and C#. Technical presentations, drinks, food, and networking.”*

Tokyo .Net Developers Meetup is held monthly, in Microsoft’s Shinagawa office - which is the fanciest office I’ve ever seen. I spent 7 years working in .NET land, so I have a soft spot for it. The talks were quite technical, so if you’re really keen on .NET and C#, this is a good meetup for you.

#### [Women in Science Japan](https://www.meetup.com/women-in-science-japan/)

*“Women in Science Japan (WISJ) is a volunteer group whose vision is to address gender inequality in the sciences in Japan.”*

WISJ events are a great space for women, gender minority persons, and allies studying or working in STEM in Japan. They regularly host online events like book clubs, and offline events like picnics or casual dinners.

Even though as a developer, I’m not a scientist, I’ve always felt super welcome at their events. I’ve been really enjoying the online book club, which provides a safe space for women to discuss and advise each other on common issues in STEM.

#### [Women Who Code Tokyo](https://www.meetup.com/women-who-code-tokyo/)

*“Women Who Code is the largest and most active community of engineers dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers.”*

WWCode Tokyo holds many regular events both online and offline. Although (unlike many tech meetups) ladies are the majority of attendees, anyone who is onboard with the goal and willing to follow the code of conduct is welcome.

The organisers are really nice and there is a huge variety of events, such as study sessions, workshops across WWCode Asia, and in-person Lightning Talk nights. The online study sessions were some of the first meetups I attended in Japan. I was able to connect with some amazing women who would provide me with advice on my career in Japan.

#### [Code Chrysalis](https://www.meetup.com/codechrysalis/)

*“Code Chrysalis is a coding school based in Tokyo with the only advanced full-stack software engineering bootcamp in Asia.”*

Code Chrysalis hosts a variety of online and offline events, generally aimed at people working or wanting to work in technology. There’s always Code Chrysalis students or graduates around at these events, so I think they’re a good chance for someone who wants to learn more about what Code Chrysalis has to offer.

#### [Le Wagon Tokyo](https://www.meetup.com/le-wagon-tokyo-coding-station/)

*“Le Wagon is a coding school for startups, creative people and tech entrepreneurs.”*

Le Wagon hosts a variety of online and offline events, and also collaborates with other community groups, allowing them use of the space to hold events. Le Wagon events are generally more geared towards people early on in their tech careers, or people hoping to get into the technology industry. They’re also a good opportunity for people interested in Le Wagon to ask the staff questions.

### Japanese Meetups

#### [Findy Online Meetups](https://findy.connpass.com/)

Findy hosts a lot of online lecture-style meetups on topics developers might be interested in. These are short, and many are held during Lunch, making them really easy to participate in.

The meetups are a good opportunity to hear from developers working in the industry, learn about the tech scene in Japan and practise your Japanese listening skills. While there isn’t much opportunity to network, the attendees and presenters are usually quite active on twitter during the event.

#### [Asakusa.rb](https://asakusarb.esa.io/)

*“Asakusa.rb is probably the most active regional Rubyist group in Japan.”*

Asakusa.rb is a Ruby study group that runs every Tuesday, currently mainly online but sometimes offline. Many standout people in the Japanese Ruby community attend this event, so if you go you’ll at least be surrounded by experts.

I’ve been told repeatedly it’s an event anyone interested in Ruby can attend, and it’s ok that I’m just working on and studying really small things. This event is really suited for people who want to learn more about Ruby, push themselves, or are keen to contribute to open source software. Asakusa.rb also hosts annual events such as Hanami and New Year's gathering, which are a great chance to chat casually with other developers, and also an opportunity to enjoy a variety of Japanese sake.  

#### [サブカル業界Developers 勉強会 (*Subculture Industry Developers Study Group*)](https://subculturedev.connpass.com/)

*“Subculture Industry Developers Study Group is a study group jointly held by companies that develop and operate services in the subculture industry.”*

A meetup for developers working or interested in the subculture industry. Through attending this I realised that manga viewer apps are technology companies in Japan. I also realised that my Japanese is not good enough to keep up with native-speaker speed. If this area is your interest, it's a great opportunity to learn more about the technology and companies behind the subculture industry in Japan.

#### [20代女性のためのスキルアップコミュニティ-mokumoku- (*Skill-up community for women in their 20s -mokumoku-*)](https://techplay.jp/community/024733_imprv_20s)

Exactly as the title says, this is a small, casual online and offline study group ideal for Japanese-speaking women in their 20s. I went to the offline meetup, and even though it was just the two of us I really appreciated the chance to chat with another woman working in the tech industry.</content>

    <title>What if We Had a Party, but the Entertainment was a Conference: Tokyu RubyKaigi 14 Recap</title>

    <content type="html">[Tokyu RubyKaigi](https://tokyurb.connpass.com/event/289120/) is a regional ruby conference held in Tokyo. I wasn’t sure what to expect from the event, the last Ruby conference I went to was [RubyKaigi](/articles/rubykaigi-2023-recap), but since this event attracted a similar audience I was keen to go.

&gt; What makes Tokyu RubyKaigi stand out from other conferences I have attended is, it’s actually a lightning talk tournament with potluck catering.

There were 27 speakers on the schedule, and if we include the sponsor talks, the talks from the winners and other impromptu talks I’m sure there were more than 30 lightning talks on the day.

Tokyu RubyKaigi was held at [Speee’s office](https://media.speee.jp/access/gt) in Roppongi Grand Tower. In contrast to our fancy surroundings we were seated on blue tarps spread out on the floor. This set the tone for the event, it was very casual — much more casual than I’d been expecting. Speakers gave their lightning talks while attendees listened, ate, drank, chatted and mingled at the back of the room.

I’ve never been to *[hanami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanami)* (having a party under sakura trees) before, but as I sat there listening to speakers and chatting with the people around me, I thought ‘this must be what *hanami* is like’.

The lightning talks covered a range of topics, from what people are currently working on, to coffee making, to a peek behind-the-scenes of running events. A gong offstage loudly signalled when the speaker’s time was up.

Aside from time constraints, it was all very casual — one speaker finished their talk by showcasing their balloon sculpting skills, another speaker was out sick and instead we watched a portion of his youtube video. The winner of the ‘LT King’ crown delivered a talk that was just titled ‘[5](https://twitter.com/okuramasafumi/status/1685243103614275584)’, and consisted of five individual short lightning talks delivered at high speed one after the other.

It felt like a warm, relaxed, and friendly audience to give a lightning talk to. I couldn’t follow everything, but I did understand the host telling us we’re concentrating too seriously, and that we should help ourselves to more food and drink.

The food and drink for the event were supplied by the attendees, and there was a huge variety to choose from. There were multiple versions of *karaage* (fried chicken), sushi, desserts, and even a pot of *motsunabe* (intestine stew). Drinks included plenty of Japanese sake, beer, soft drinks and Starbucks drip coffee.

Attendees were encouraged to bring enough for 1-2 people, but there was no limit on how much you could bring. Supplying food or alcohol put you in the running for the title of ‘Food King’ (飯王, *meshi ou*) or ‘Alcohol King’ (酒王, *sake ou*), so if you brought enough for everyone to have a taste, you could score more votes.

The event also had quite a few un-scheduled lightning talks.

During the first break, the LT Lottery was held and a few participants were chosen at random to give a lightning talk at the end of the day. I hadn’t realised the lottery included all attendees, but thankfully my name wasn't drawn. Despite saying she didn’t come prepared for this, [@enorima](https://twitter.com/emorima/status/1685193430010613760?s=20) pulled off great lightning talk, advertising the upcoming event [Oedo RubyKaigi 10](https://asakusarb.doorkeeper.jp/events/161095).

The two crowned Food Kings and single Sake King also had to deliver a short speech. At a more formal event this would be a daunting prospect, but not here. One winner, who had brought *[motsunabe](https://twitter.com/rira100000000/status/1685247943002218496?s=20)* made according to his Grandpa’s recipe, tried to call his grandfather on stage (unfortunately neither his grandpa or grandma picked up the phone). The Alcohol King had actually been aiming for Food King, and so delivered the food presentation he had been hoping to show had he won his intended title.

The event was so much fun, I loved seeing so many people enjoying themselves and showcasing things they’re passionate about. I really want to try giving a (scheduled) lightning talk next year! I feel like it’s a recurring theme when going to Ruby-related events in Japan, they make you so excited and eager to dive into Ruby. The Ruby community is so welcoming and enthusiastic, and their passion for the language and learning is contagious.

If you have interest in Ruby, can understand Japanese, want to connect with new people, and are not daunted by the prospects of giving an impromptu lightning talk, this is the event for you!</content>

    <title>Working with Tech Recruiters in Japan</title>

    <content type="html">**Recruiters, Consultants, Career Advisors, Headhunters.**

I've heard so many names from different people that I've talked to, but all in all, the bulk of the work is the same -- they receive information on what kind of employee a client wants to hire, and start looking for that candidate. Sounds simple enough, right?

But after working with and talking to several recruiters, I've realized that there's more that goes into the process than cold-calling, blasting out emails and messaging on LinkedIn.

On the other hand, as a software developer looking for new opportunities, applicants might end up getting messaged or called by recruiters. And I get it--it's annoying especially when you've just posted a job update and aren't open to work on LinkedIn but they're still messaging you if you want a "new career opportunity". So most of the time, some applicants have a negative image of recruiters, especially if they've had previous experience working with recruiters before they came to Japan.

“You don’t message recruiters — you wait for them to message you” is what a friend had told me one time, when I asked him for advise while I was still in the middle of looking for a job. Setting your location to the place where you’re looking for a job in and keeping your LinkedIn profile updated helps recruiters see your profile when they’re looking for keywords associated with the job descriptions they’re working on. To increase your visibility to recruiters, there's even this feature on LinkedIn, where you can set your profile to "Open to Work" for Recruiters only, or you can also set it to Public with a frame added on your profile photo.

But looking for a good recruiter to work with requires you to put yourself out there more times than you’re used to. Looking at the credibility of their profiles may not necessarily be enough, and working with them might be the only way you could know for sure if their approach works well for you.

But I've seen things pan out the other way--I've heard of juniors messaging recruiters looking for job opportunities but none of the recruiters replying to them because it's hard to give them matches. Maybe because their experience in the field isn't enough and the clients aren't looking to hire new graduates, or their profiles just don't match what the client is looking for. Sometimes they are promised a call or a message once a new opportunity comes up, but most of the time that doesn't happen and the applicant effectively gets "ghosted".

The bad impression of recruiters in other countries (magnified by popular Reddit posts) leaves a lot of non-Japanese folks looking for a new job in Japan and getting approached by recruiters to be very wary of them.

Personally, there are a few recruiters that have been really helpful in my job search-- those who really knew what they were doing and tried their best to help me become more "marketable". Those people are quite hard to find, but I was lucky that I've been able to encounter those kinds of people.

So in this article, I want to clarify some misconceptions about recruitment work--what actually goes on during the process, what kinds of recruiters to avoid and which ones to work with, and why it's not a loss to consider working with one.

## How does recruitment work in Japan?

Job-hunting websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, Daijob and Career Cross are just some of the websites where you can easily get messages from recruiters. Sometimes, recruitment companies--typically called 人材紹介会社 (jinzai shoukai kaisha, or employment agency)-- would have their own websites for job openings and you can apply for jobs through them.

But typically, recruiters would post job openings on their LinkedIn feed or on the job board of the website and filter through the applicants sending in their resumes. But most of the time, they would look at profiles; which candidates actually have matches with the job descriptions, and which ones don't. There are different approaches to this process depending on the recruiter and the client, but there's typically two types: a general approach, where the recruiter tries to contact several people within the same industry who look like they have some qualifications, get them to apply for the job, and find out more about what the client wants; and another is a targeted approach, where they're focused on looking for candidates who have a specific skillset or relevant experience within the industry.

No matter which approach it is, most of the time, recruiters will send a message asking for a 30-45 minute discussion (online or in-person) to hear "what the applicant wants" for their career, and maybe even discuss open job opportunities that might match what they're looking for. When doing general searches though, recruiters would usually do cold-calling and discuss with you right then and there if you allow it.

A newer approach from recruitment companies that I've seen is organizing meetup events for job-hunters and having their discussions online (or now in-person, since the pandemic restrictions have been lifted). However, not a lot of companies have adopted this so far and it's not that common.

A frequent question that I come across with is "how do recruiters get compensated"? Do you have to pay them for each application, or do you pay them once they successfully place you for a job? Or maybe the employer already has that deducted from your first salary, since they're working directly with the recruiter?

In Japan, it's neither of those options. It's the client companies who are working directly with these recruiters and are paying them compensation for each successful placement, so there's no deductions or charges made on the side of the applicant. A good thing about this is that competent recruiters will try their best to find the job best suited to you and help you step-by-step to get there. On the downside, the incompetent recruiters will just try to push any possible job opening at you and make you apply for all of those so that they could get placements.

The recruitment industry [is also regulated in Japan](/articles/recruiting-in-japan) -- recruitment agencies are required to get licenses in order to make their business legal and need to adhere to government regulations. The recruiters are typically also provided with training on how to work as a recruiter for different industries. But there's no strict guidelines on how they go about with getting placements for applicants, which is why working with different recruiters from the same company could also lead to different experiences.

Recruiters also need to be certified as a "Career Consultant" in order to be able to give advise to people who are looking for a job, as Annie Chang, founder of AC Global Solutions and considered as the pioneer of IT recruitment in Japan, explains. "Those [recruitment agencies] in Japan are very much established and they all have this system."

For non-Japanese applicants, you would probably notice that a lot of people reaching out to you (especially if you're not fluent in Japanese) are also non-Japanese. Aside from a lot of Japanese people not being fluent in English, it's also related to the low barrier for entry into the industry, and that it often does not require fluency in Japanese.

## How to work with recruiters in Japan

Japan is a talent-short market, so it requires a lot of flexibility on the side of the recruiters. Understanding how the hiring manager thinks, understanding the job description well, being able to bridge the gap between what the clients want and what the applicants are looking for are just some of the things that they need to put into consideration when trying to make a successful job placement.

From the recruiters I've interviewed for this article, both agreed that having a personal touch is one of the benefits of working with a recruiter.

Annie likes approaching her candidates the old-fashioned way, as opposed to checking social media platforms like most recruiters do nowadays. "It's like a marriage, you know. Like you're match-making this person to this company. You have to consider the people's happiness, their mental health, their financial conditions, everything." Annie shares from her 34 years of experience working in the recruitment industry. "A good recruiter will let you know about the job market, mentor you a little bit, guide you and help you get good information."

Omar Regalado, a Tech Recruiter with previous experience working as a Finance Recruiter shares his insights on the industry. "When working with a recruiter, it's not just that specific recruiter who knows about your profile, it's everyone in the company. Because of that, you will have more presence in the market and more people can help you with advancing in the process."

Andrea Sun, a current Lead Software Engineer who has started working in Japan since last year, mentions, "Of course there are lots of recruiters out there, but I could probably categorize them into two categories: the ones that are focused on what their clients want and would push candidates that don't necessarily fit the job description just so they could fill in that position; and then there are the ones that actually care about what the candidate wants."

She also cites that the best recruiters with whom she had worked with helped her practice interviews, gave her tips on how to answer questions, and would only give her one job recommendation at a time so as to not overwhelm her. And it worked, because it helped her focus on what was in front of her at the moment.

Jonas Villanueva talks about how there are more benefits than hindrances to working with recruiters.  "When you're applying through job boards, most applications might get ignored and don't even get past the document screening phase. But there are sometimes companies that work exclusively with recruiters, or even entire teams in recruitment companies who would work for these bigger client companies." He also mentions that aside from being able to network with the job market, some recruiters also tend to have access to information that is not yet available to the public so in a sense, you could get a leg-up in your application process.

Software developers that I've interviewed recall recruiters who gave unwarranted career advice or pushed them to apply for positions that they didn't have interest in or were not relevant to the career paths that they wanted to take as the types who they don't really want to work with again. Which is why it's important to consider and check the validity of the recruiter's profile and the credibility of the company that they're working with to weed out the possibility of encountering such kinds of recruiters. Some recruiters have had previous experience in the field itself that they're currently working with and just genuinely want to help other people get a new job in that field.

Louise Bawas recalls feeling frustrated over getting ghosted by several recruiters after saying that they will "keep in touch", but has learned throughout the process not to take things personally.

Understandably, a lot of software developers might also feel like working with a recruiter is a waste of time, especially if they've been through a streak of encountering incompetent recruiters. Applicants should be able to work with recruiters who are willing to help them build a better future for the career path that they’ve chosen, not with someone who simply orders them around on what to do and only sees them as a statistic in a list of successful job placements.

## Final Words

There is a huge shortage of bilingual employees in Japan, and it seems like the need to have Japanese-speaking employees specifically is causing more harm than good to several industries in Japan.

Applying for a job sometimes feels like it is a full-time job in it of itself and things might get overwhelming, especially if you're working on other things like working for a regular full-time job or finishing your requirements for graduation.

Annie has advised that some employers need to lower their barriers for entry in order to fill those vacant positions easier. These barriers aren't only making it harder for applicants to look for jobs in the middle of a looming financial crisis, but it's also difficult for recruiters to find matches for these clients. There would be people who are interested in applying for different industries in Japan, but whose applications are getting ignored due to their Japanese level. "Right now I think some companies have lowered the qualifications to N1 or N2 level [from the previous standard of needing native level Japanese fluency], but there's still so much that the candidates have to qualify for."

Some developers who had JLPT N2 said that it was definitely easier for recruiters to find jobs for them since it opened more opportunities for them to apply, but not having this specific qualification was not completely a hindrance in looking for a job.

Despite the tightening budget caused by the drop in the value of yen and the global financial crisis, Omar shares that these lay-offs in other industries might be a good blessing to other industries. "Positions in data, back office IT work like IT support, infrastructure, and cybersecurity are roles that are in demand not only in the tech companies but are becoming increasingly important in other industries as well in order to keep up with the evolving technology."

It's worth keeping in mind that staying in touch with a number of recruiters before or after you're ready to start looking for a new job may actually help you on the long run with your job hunting, but it's not a bad thing to work with several recruiters at the same time to keep your options a bit more open.

Sometimes landing a job requires much more than just technical skills--it requires luck and connections. And you might not end up with the perfect job, but you can end up with a job that matches you perfectly.

    <title>Paternity Leave in Japan</title>

    <content type="html">If you're an expectant father in Japan, you may be considering taking paternity leave. Compared to many places in the world, Japan's policy is generous, on paper at least: you're legally entitled to take up to a year off, and be compensated during that time. 

However, you'll likely face some obstacles too. The system itself is complicated and has had a number of changes in recent years, meaning that there's little English information available. Furthermore, while the situation is improving, recent data showed that only 17% of fathers in Japan took the leave, and so you may find your company doesn't have a culture where paternity leave is encouraged.

This article will give you an outline of the system, explaining your options, and what benefits they give. It will also highlight the recent changes to the system 

## Japan's paternity leave system

In Japan, paternity leave falls into two main kinds of leave: Childcare at Birth Leave (出生時育児休業) and Childcare Leave (育児休業).

### Availability of paternity leave in Japan

Paternity leave is only available to people who are considered employed, so it is not available to directors of companies or sole proprietors. In addition to company employees, it is also available to limited term contract workers, provided their contract will not be terminated before the child turns 8 months old (Childcare at Birth Leave) or 18 months old (Childcare Leave).

Furthermore, in the case of Childcare Leave, those who work part-time are excluded if they have not worked at least 11 days per month, for at least 12 of the past 24 months.

Additionally, if a company has a labor-management agreement, they can exclude some people who would normally be eligible for paternity leave, including

* those who have worked for less than a year for the company 
* those who work less than 2 days per week 
* (in the case of Childcare Leave) those who are scheduled to end their employment or contract within one year after they apply for childcare leave

Childcare Leave is also available to fathers who adopt a child under one year old, starting from the adoption date.

### Paternity leave benefits in Japan

With Childcare at Birth Leave, fathers receive 67% of their salary as a benefit with the maximum of 15,190 yen per day.

With Childcare Leave, they get 67% of the salary for the first 180 days of the leave with [an upper limit of 305,319 yen](https://jsite.mhlw.go.jp/nara-roudoukyoku/content/contents/001250909.pdf) per month. After the first 180 days, 50% will be covered with a limit of 227,850 yen per month. 

While this amount may look like a small amount, it's worth noting this payment is not taxable. You don't need to pay income tax or residence tax, nor do you need to pay for social insurance such as employment insurance, health insurance and pension insurance while on childcare leave. So this means your take home pay should be similar to your regular salary, unless you have significantly higher than average compensation.

### Duration of paternity leave in Japan

With Childcare at Birth Leave, new fathers are eligible to take 4 weeks of leave in the 8 weeks after childbirth.

Childcare Leave is available until the day before the child’s first birthday. If you go back to work before the birthday, you’ll get paid until the day before going back to work.

Additionally, if both parents are working, the [Dad and Mom Childcare Leave Plus](https://jsite.mhlw.go.jp/tokyo-roudoukyoku/var/rev0/0146/0019/papamama.pdf) (パパ・ママ育休プラス) system will allow one parent to continue their leave until their child is 14 months, albeit for a maximum of 12 months in total, but only if they start their leave after the other parent and apply before the child turns 1 year old.

Furthermore, if you can’t find a daycare for the child by their first birthday, childcare leave can be extended to a maximum of 24 months, during which the benefit will continue to be paid.

### Which system of paternity leave should you use?

Fathers who plan to take an extended paternity leave will typically take the first four weeks using the Childcare at Birth Leave system, and then the remainder using the Childcare Leave system. This will maximize the time they receive 67% of their salary (4 weeks + 180 days).

## Nursing leave

Once fathers return to work, they are also entitled to take nursing leave (子の看護休暇). This is a day (or time) you can take off work, for the purpose of taking your child (who must be under the age of 7) to the doctor or to receive vaccinations. This leave is regulated by the Child Care and Family Care Leave Act. A parent can take up to 5 days off work per child every year regardless of the employer’s rules. 

However, since the Act doesn't mention if it’s paid or unpaid leave, you don’t get any financial support for this short leave unless your employer offers it individually. If the employer offers paid leave for this, the government gives subsidies to the company. Though it may sound great, the employer needs to submit detailed and complicated paperwork to the government in order to receive a [1,000 yen subsidy per hour of nursing leave](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/001082093.pdf).

## Paternity leave in practice

According to a [report](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/toukei/list/dl/71-r04/03.pdf) by the Japanese government, only 17.13% of fathers took paternity leave in 2022, compared to 80.2% of women.

**Parental Leave by Gender in Japan**

Year | Men | Women
-----|-----|-------
2022 | 17.13% | 80.2%
2021 | 13.97% | 85.1%
2020 | 12.65% | 81.6%
2019 | 7.48% | 83.0%
2018 | 6.16% | 82.2%

The main reasons why [new fathers didn’t take paternity leave](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/11901000/000687802.pdf) were that their company was unprepared to offer them the leave (23.4%), and they felt the company didn’t want them to take the leave (21.8%). 22.6% were concerned that their income would decrease. 

Furthermore, it is not uncommon for parents to experience harassment related to pregnancy, childbirth and childcare leave at work. [A 2020 report](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/11910000/000775797.pdf) indicated 26% of parents had experienced harassment related to pregnancy, childbirth and childcare leave. 

Examples of this harassment are things like new mothers being asked to take pay cuts or even to quit work when they request childcare leave from their company, or new fathers being prevented from taking childcare leave or receiving a demotion after returning from leave. 

This sort of harassment violates the regulations around parental leave, but Japanese companies tend to get away with it with little repercussions, as at worst they’ll be subject to a fine of up to only ¥200,000.

This situation is one that the Japanese government has been looking to change, and in recent years they've introduced a number of policies designed to improve the situation, with a target that 30% of fathers in Japan take paternity leave by 2025.

In order to improve this situation, the Child Care and Family Care Leave Act was [updated twice](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/11900000/000909605.pdf) in 2022. 

The first new regulation came into force in April 2022 and required companies to give enough information to all new mothers and fathers about parental leave, and encourage them to take the leave. This was to address that many fathers were never given any information about parental leave, including its advantages and financial support (64.7% weren't given information according to a 2018 study).

The second regulation was introduced in October 2022, granting new fathers Childcare at Birth Leave (出生時育児休業). Prior to that, only mothers could take it.

Then in April 2023 a new regulation came into effect. Companies with more than 1,000 employees are required to publish an annual report with the percentage of employees who took paternity leave and maternity leave. It is difficult to fully quantify the satisfaction of new parents due to these new regulations, but I hope these governmental moves will help new parents balance their work and family life.

So while paternity leave may have a ways to go before being commonly embraced in Japan, it is heading in the right direction. This shifting attitude not only provides fathers the opportunity to bond with their young children, but also will help mitigate the burden of many [working mothers in Japan](/articles/progress-and-challenges-reflections-of-a-working-mother-in-japan) who struggle to continue their career after childbirth. </content>

    </author>
    <content type="html">There isn't much information available about being a software engineering intern in Japan. I remember when I first considered doing one that I wanted an online resource on the topic. Now that I've done several software engineering internships at Japanese companies, I'll help remedy the situation. In this article, I will share my experiences of working as a SWE intern and give tips for landing your first tech internship.

## My background	

I have always had an interest in technology but never got to study it in depth in highschool. To keep my options open for specialization down the line, I opted to study business in Japan with a focus on IT. 

During the height of the pandemic in 2021, I decided to commit 3 months of my free time to study programming. Well, 3 months turned into a year and then two. Since then, I have worked at a number of companies as a software engineer intern and also landed a freelance gig. Now I work at [Tokyo Techies](https://www.tokyotechies.com), an IT start-up, as an intern while keeping up with my last year of study in university. 

## In Japan, most internships last a single day

In Japan, the word "internship" typically refers to a chance to experience the company environment. [One study](https://shushokumirai.recruit.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/topic_24s_20230418.pdf) shows that 89.7% of internships students participated in lasted only a single day. [Another survey](https://www.mext.go.jp/content/20220127-mxt_gakushi01-000010706_01.pdf) conducted by MEXT showed that 15.8% of university students did internships for more than a month and only 23.8% were paid. However, [MEXT’s internship survey](https://www.meti.go.jp/shingikai/economy/long_term_internship/pdf/003_03_00.pdf) pointed out that a high proportion of IT engineers had longer internships (p.9). 

If you're reading this article, a "one day internship" probably isn't what you're looking for. Don't worry, the focus will be on longer (and ideally) paid internships.

## My typical day to day as an intern

My current company, Tokyo Techies, offers hybrid work options and flexible hours.  Thanks to this, I can work from home and with hours that fit with my equally busy university study schedule. In a typical working week, I put in 20 to 28 hours,  depending on how much university demands from me. 

As far as contribution goes, I have worked on feature development to bug fixes. Most recently, I have had the chance to develop the company’s project automation testing from the ground up. By standardizing best practices to end to end tests, I've helped to ensure a stable and high quality release.

## Advice on Internships

As students, we are told to fill the resume with as much relevant experience to our chosen field as possible. Since I did not find my interest in software engineering until my second year of university, I had an uphill battle in this competitive job market. Along the way I have learned some valuable lessons that hopefully will be useful for others.

### Look for hidden internship opportunities

The easiest internship opportunities to find are at big tech companies like [HENNGE](/companies/hennge) or [Mercari](/companies/mercari), who use them as a means to recruit future talent who can join full-time after graduation. Naturally, these positions are highly competitive, you are essentially competing with the best of the best on a local and sometimes global level.

However, when you dig deeper,  there are also many hidden opportunities for internships and jobs in the local start-up scene in Japan. Therefore, it's important to familiarize yourself with the local tech scene. 

There are many popular [tech meetups in Tokyo](/articles/tech-meetups-in-tokyo), from developers to UI/UX design to entrepreneurship and even ones run by TokyoDev. I recommend going to the ones that fit your chosen field of interest and meet the people in the scene. This will increase your chances of landing an internship or even a full-time offer.

This is how I found two opportunities that were never publicly available. I simply knew people working at the company.

### Find ways to showcase your skills

Working on personal projects as well as contributing to open-source can be a great way to improve your resume, as it shows people you’re eager to learn and contribute. Personally I created [my own blog](https://themokapot.dev) where I write about my experiences learning web technologies, as well as data structure and algorithms, and even some 3D web experiments. The blog not only showcases my interest in programming but gives interviewers the chance to ask more specific technical questions. They had referenced specific parts of my project and asked how I came up with solutions to certain challenges. 

### The best internships treat you like another engineer

Find internships where you will get as much hands-on experience as possible. In my opinion the best internship is one where you are treated like another engineer. You are working just like other fellow engineers to improve the product. When interviewing, ask what your responsibilities will be if you get the job. I personally try to gauge the learning opportunities that I will get as much as possible from the interview. 

Prior to my current internship, I was already working at a different startup on a freelancing basis, but decided that I could get more learning opportunities elsewhere. I wanted to work in a bigger team where I could get more mentorship and guidance from senior engineers. Since switching to my current company, I have been treated like a normal software engineer and given proper responsibilities and freedom to contribute. For this reason I couldn’t be happier at my current workplace.

### Freelancing is also an option

After you gain a bit more experience with an internship, freelancing also becomes a possibility. After two relatively short term internships, I went on a search for new opportunities again and managed to find a remote freelancing job at a Japanese startup doing full-stack development on indeed.com. I had two informal interviews before receiving the offer from the company.

Freelance contracts can vary greatly from company to company but for myself I was asked to spend 20 hours a week (80 hours a month) working and I will always receive a fixed payment. I could work those 20 hours on any working day of the week as long as the assigned tasks are completed. The workload was quite manageable with it mostly being bug fixes or the occasional feature development so it was perfect for my school schedule. 

However, unlike internships, freelancing comes with expectations to deliver results. This experience taught me to be conservative with work estimation and communicate realistic expectations. Failing to do so will result in disappointment from the client and extra stress on yourself. Being able to communicate uncertainty and set realistic expectations are very valuable skills for any career path. 

### Pace yourself!

Speaking from personal experience, it is not easy to juggle responsibilities for work and school. If you do decide to take on any tech internship while studying at university, it is important to communicate with your manager at work about your time commitment, especially when nearing exam seasons. Your time management skills will be put to the test. However, remember that unlike university, internship is an additive experience, not a mandatory responsibility. Always prioritize your studies. 

### Conclusion

Internship is undoubtedly a great way to introduce yourself into the world of technology in Japan. The potential for learning can be comparable to working full-time if you do find a company that is willing to invest in you and value your effort. I hope this article was informative to those who are taking their first step into the tech world in Japan.

I truly believe when you work and study with a passion opportunities will undoubtedly come your way. Best of luck on your search!</content>

    <content type="html">This article is informed primarily by my experiences as a deaf American living in Japan for the last 16 years. Even though I do not have a mobility disability, I have also included notes about mobility accessibility because I also have some awareness of those through relatives. I hope that this article will be generally informative for everyone, even if you do not have a disability or if you have a disability that is not deafness.

&lt;div class="embedded-text" markdown="1"&gt;
Note: When I use Japanese terms to refer to a person with disabilities, I will use the Japanese 障がい者 (_shougaisha_). People with disabilities have often chosen to render the middle がい in _hiragana_, rather than the Chinese character 害, due to the latter's negative association with wrong-doing, harm, and disaster. [Many](https://www.pref.oita.jp/soshiki/12500/hyouki.html) [official](https://www.city.kofu.yamanashi.jp/shogaifukushi/hiragana.html) [government](https://www.pref.mie.lg.jp/KENKIKA/SOGOH/23460023167.htm) [communications](https://www.city.osaka.lg.jp/fukushi/page/0000181235.html) have also chosen to follow this rendering.
&lt;/div&gt;

There are not many official sources with proper translations in English regarding living in Japan with a disability, so I have chosen to link to official Japanese sources, as they are the clearest and provide the necessary terminology for further research.


## Difficulties in Japan as a person with a disability

Disabilities and the choices that you make to live with them are intensely personal topics. Living in Japan with a disability is difficult, whether you were born and raised here or not. These difficulties can become worse the more you need or expect accommodations. After all, two things people often mention about Japanese culture are "the nail that sticks up gets hammered down" and the importance of "harmony". Disabilities go against both of these ideas.

There are still train stations without reasonable accommodations for wheelchair users. Many buildings are also inaccessible due to narrow doorways, stairs that cannot be bypassed, or steps up from the street level. Many restaurants are too small or narrow and will refuse you—politely—if you have a disability they cannot accommodate. Even Japanese homes are culturally hostile to those with mobility issues; a hallmark of a Japanese home is the entry hall (玄関, _genkan_), which has a prominent, raised step from the entry hall to the actual interior.

Many places will offer some form of accommodation, only to have the point of failure be the employee in charge of the accommodation. Signs saying "[we will write for you](https://www.zennancho.or.jp/mimimark/mimimark/)" are common. However, workers or even doctors can refuse to write at all, write only "keywords", or label you as difficult and attempt to ignore you in the future.

Agency is the ability to have control over the choices you make and how to act on them. Many people with disabilities are robbed of their agency by people around them. If you have a disability that creates friction or discomfort for others, it is not uncommon to have well-intentioned employees unilaterally take control of your situation. I have had experienced employees making decisions, going through entire processes without informing me about what they were doing or why. I have seen wheelchair users forcibly picked up and lifted over steps without offer or warning.

It is also not uncommon to see people staring at, talking about, or avoiding people with disabilities.

With all of this, it isn't a surprise that in [a Japanese government survey about discrimination against people with disabilities](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/11/national/social-issues/disability-discrimination-japan-survey/), almost 90% of survey respondents reported feeling that discrimination exists.


## Accommodations in Japan

This is not to say that Japan is completely hostile to those with disabilities. These things happen to people in other countries as well. However, in my experience, Japan can be less accessible and accommodating than other places.

Some accommodations are immediately apparent. Any major city or station is the large, yellow blocks with raised stripes or dots for people with visual disabilities. The stripes indicate the flow of foot traffic, while the dots indicate where to stop or exercise caution. Additionally, large intersections will have extremely loud beeps with different patterns to indicate when it is safe to cross.

In the public transportation system, trains and buses have accommodations for people with mobility disabilities; when notified ahead of time, employees will use portable ramps to help passengers onto the train/bus near designated seating areas. This is an institutionalized method of making public transport accessible. These types of accommodations are equally necessary for not only people who have mobility issues, but also the number of people among Japan's aging population who will develop mobility issues in the near future.

There are other types of assistance available through the Japanese bureaucracy.

## The Japanese disability certificate

One of the most common (and among foreigners, divisive) places to start is the "disability certificate" (障がい者手帳, _shougaisha techou_). There are three types:

* Physical disability certificate (身体障がい者手帳, _shintai shougaisha techou_): for people with a physical disability that impacts their daily lives
* Mental disability health/welfare certificate (精神障がい者保険福祉手帳, _seishin shougaisha hoken fukushi techou_): for people with a mental disability that impacts their daily lives
* Education and support certificate (療育手帳, _ryouiku techou_): for people with developmental delays

The primary requirement for a disability certificate is an examination with a [designated medical professional](https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/shoufuku/techou/15shiteii.html). Anyone can ask for an examination, but the specifics of the certificate will depend on the results of that examination. Applying for a certificate is **completely optional**, but having a disability certificate unlocks many benefits and discounts (障がい者割引, _shougaisha waribiki_).

These certificates can be divisive among foreigners on privacy grounds: it can feel invasive to go to a doctor to have the specifics of your disability and health judged, and then disclosed to the government for further categorization and official registration. This feeling is only intensified when you have to show your certificate to a worker or an employee for verification in order to receive a benefit or discount, or when you need to "check in" with the social welfare counter at the municipal office after moving.

My experience is primarily with the physical disability certificate, so that is what I will speak about the most.

There are [seven levels](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/file/06-Seisakujouhou-12200000-Shakaiengokyokushougaihokenfukushibu/0000172197.pdf) (級, _kyuu_) to the physical disability certificate, with 7 being the least severe, and 1 being the most severe. Each level has specific definitions to ensure that the system is fair.

These seven categories are [broadly separated into two large groups](https://www.fukunavi.or.jp/fukunavi/eip/20kuwashiku/20k_fukusu_service/waribiki/1-2syogaisya.html): "Type 1" and "Type 2". Broadly speaking, levels 1-3 are considered Type 1, and levels 4-7 are considered Type 2. Benefit eligibility and scale are often determined by whether a certificate holder falls into the Type 1 or Type 2 category, rather than the specific disability level.

There is additionally an "exceptional" (特別, _tokubetsu_) category with separate requirements. The [National Tax Office](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/shinkoku/tebiki/2022/03/order3/yogo/3-3_y05.htm) and a few other government agencies use it to determine eligibility for various benefits. It is similar to the Type 1 category in that it is strictly defined based on the severity and effect of the disability.

## Benefits of having a disability certificate

Many major benefits are available for Type 1 certificate holders, with Type 2 certificate holders receiving fewer or no benefits. For example, [JR provides fare discounts](https://www.jreast.co.jp/equipment/waribiki/) of 50% for a Type 1 certificate holder and their guardian or helper; however, a Type 2 certificate holder **cannot** obtain the discount for their guardian or helper.

Other places, such as [museums](https://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_free_page/index.php?id=128), [aquariums](https://www.sumida-aquarium.com/about/price/index.html), and [movie theaters](https://www.unitedcinemas.jp/toshimaen/faq.php?subcategory=78#qa_594) will offer free entry or discounts. The process varies depending on venues. Some will require you to present your disability certificate to a human at a window in order to purchase a ticket with the discount. Others, like movie theaters, will allow you to purchase a ticket with the discount online or at a kiosk, but require you to present your disability certificate along with the ticket for verification on entry.

Municipal governments also offer various types of benefits or help. Toei is a public transport system in Tokyo run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many people overseas think of "Tokyo" as primarily the wards (e.g.: Shinjuku, Shibuya, Taito, et al), but Tokyo is a prefectural-level government with a jurisdiction covering many cities, towns, villages, and even islands. Any resident of the greater prefectural Tokyo-level jurisdiction who meets their local municipality's requirements can receive [a pass from Toei](https://www.kotsu.metro.tokyo.jp/other/kanren/fare/free.html) that allows them to ride the Toei transit system for free. The only caveat is that this too requires disclosure: often, you must show your Toei free pass to the station employee working the ticket gate. Some versions of the pass are compatible with some stiles that allow you to insert the pass itself into the ticket stile. There is a Pasmo version that can be issued in some municipalities, but it has its own restrictions.

&lt;div class="embedded-text" markdown="1"&gt;
The idea of these discounts can be divisive. Why should people receive discounts or stipends for having a disability? Isn't that unfair? The reality is that people with disabilities, especially in Japan, often have lower incomes, yet higher expenses. Discounts like these are an accommodation that helps offset other, unseen expenses, such as requiring a helper, or needing to take a taxi, or even medical fees and costs that are not directly provided for.
&lt;/div&gt;

The Japanese government also provides direct financial help to people with disabilities, or to parents of children with disabilities. Many municipalities offer straightforward stipends for people with disability certificates if they meet certain requirements. For example, [Arakawa Ward](https://www.city.arakawa.tokyo.jp/a030/shougaisha/teate/sinsinsyougaisyateat.html) in Tokyo will give 15,500 yen per month to people with a level 1 or 2 physical disability certificate, as long as they are beneath the specified income level.

The people who will be most knowledgeable about these types of assistance will be the ones who work at the "welfare for people with disabilities" counter/window (often 障がい者福祉課, _shougaisha fukushi-ka_) at the municipal office.

The Japanese government further provides financial assistance indirectly. For example, people with disability certificates can receive [income tax deductions](https://www.nta.go.jp/publication/pamph/koho/kurashi/html/03_2.htm). Certificate holders are eligible for a 270,000 yen deduction on income taxes; those who have an [exceptional disability](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/shinkoku/tebiki/2022/03/order3/yogo/3-3_y05.htm) instead qualify for a 400,000 yen deduction.

## Disability certificate holders in the workforce

The government also attempts to use [financial incentives](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/koyou_roudou/koyou/jigyounushi/page10.html) to discourage companies from discriminating against people with disabilities via a legal mandate. In simple terms, a company with more than 100 employees is expected to meet a mandate of employing disability certificate holders for at least 2.3% of their workforce. Companies that do not meet that number must pay a fee of 50,000 yen per person per month. These numbers can change based on several factors, but are sufficient to help us understand a rough impact.

For a rough example: a company with 200 employees would be expected to have at least 2.3%, or five people with disability certificates. If that company did not employ any disability certificate holders, it would be expected to pay 50,000 yen per "missing" employee, which would add up to:

* 250,000 yen per month
* 3,000,000 yen per year

This can be the salary of an entry-level hire and is not insignificant.

The impact of this system is undeniable, with [the government reporting](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/11704000/001027391.pdf) rising numbers of people with disabilities in the workforce. However, numbers do not tell the full story. Many companies are reluctant to hire people with disabilities for skilled or senior level labor and instead turn to [sponsoring sports teams with disabilities](https://xtech.nikkei.com/dm/atcl/column/15/111000019/090500012/?P=3), or opening up low-skill, low-paying, dead end positions.

There is often no way to reasonably avoid disclosing disabilities to employers if you need any kind of accommodation; they will often proactively ask for a copy of your disability certificate. A large part of this is that they will often want to register you as one of the mandated employees with a disability as described above. Another reason is that employers usually handle their employees' taxes, which will also require disclosure.

## Disclosure of disabilities

Disclosure and the way it is treated in Japan can be one of the most difficult adjustments for a foreigner with a disability. Something that is often private in other countries is expected and understood to be semi-public in Japan. Before the pandemic, when I commuted for work and went out more frequently, it was common for me to have to disclose my disability in multiple ways every single day.

Sometimes I would be subject to annoyed questioning ("you don't _look_ like you have a disability, why do you have this?") or employees would ask to examine the details of my disability certificate to "verify" that I was "really" disabled. I have also been subject to impromptu "examinations" to "verify" my deafness—usually involving someone yelling at me very loudly. It can be difficult to stay cool in those situations, but as both a person with a disability and also as a foreigner, staying calm is a must.

Many Japanese people feel that friction as well, and not just in the need to disclose, but also the physical act of showing the disability certificate itself. Keeping the disability certificate—which can range from a printed sheet, to a folded note card, to a plastic card, to a booklet—is a burden, and so is having to remove it from its protective case to show to other people frequently. Recently, an app called [Mirairo ID](https://mirairo-id.jp/) has allowed people with disability certificates to officially electronically register their disability certificates and keep them on their smartphone. While Mirairo ID cannot reduce the need to disclose, it does reduce the friction in disclosure..

I obviously did not let my disability keep me from moving, working, or establishing a life here. Even if I knew what I know today, warts and all, I think I would have still made the decision to emigrate to Japan. As with anything, there are trade-offs: some things are better, some things are worse. I do wish I had known about the option to get a disability certificate earlier in my time here, as it would have helped tremendously when I was struggling on a lower salary.

While there is no way for me to travel back 16 years ago and help myself in the past, I hope this article can help other people who are looking into moving to Japan.</content>

&gt; To get a mobile number, you need to set up your residence card.\\
&gt; To finish setting up your residence card, you need an address.\\
&gt; But wait, you still don’t have an apartment, so you have no address!


I moved to Japan by myself in 2022 on a [Working Holiday visa](/articles/japanese-engineering-visa-options), and had to run around (and waste time) getting everything sorted - here is my recommendation on what order you do these things in! While I’ve heard that you need a *hanko* (personal seal), I’ve managed without one.


(Of course, if your company is bringing you over, or you have friends willing to help you out, you might want to do things a little differently! This is just a recommendation for people who aren’t quite sure where to begin.)


## 1. Get an Address
- This can be a temporary address (like an airbnb or sharehouse, maybe not a hotel), you just need somewhere where you can receive mail.
- There are also companies who can help you secure a place while you’re still overseas, but I wanted to inspect my options in person and felt I’d have more choice if I was searching while staying somewhere in Japan.


 *Now that you have an address, you can go to the local ward office to…*


## 2. Finish Setting Up your Residence Card; Register Your Address
- Officially when you have decided your permanent address, you need to register it [within 14 days of moving in](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/nyuukokukanri10_00021.html?hl=en). Temporary, short-term accomodation doesn't technically meet those requirements (you're moving out in like a month!), however you do need an address registered to do everything else in this guide.
- Your ward office might not accept a hotel address.
- As it’s the first time you’re visiting the local ward office, there are a number of procedures to complete ー the staff are pretty good at helping you work out what you need!
- Be prepared to sit and wait a while.


 *Now you have your residence card with your address on it, your next move should be to…*


## 3. Get a Sim Card
- Life in Japan will be hard with no mobile number, between signing up for things and two-factor authentication you need a Japanese mobile number.
- The easiest way to pay is with a credit card.
- I recommend applying online! But you can do it in person too.
 - When you complete the application online, the sim card will be mailed to your address.
 - If you go in person, they have to explain every line of the contract to you and it takes hours, **literally hours**.
 - Depending on what visa you have, not all providers will be able to give you a sim card. Personally, I relied heavily on google translate and went with [LINEMO](https://www.linemo.jp).
- There are also companies like [Mobal](https://www.mobal.com/japan-sim-card/) who can give you a Japanese number without a residence card.


 *Now you have a sim card, you have a phone number, which means you can…*


## 4. Sort out your Bank Account
- Japan has various banks, and some are more foreigner friendly than others - online application, no *hanko* needed, etc. Check the details before applying and pick the bank that best suits your circumstances.
- When you complete the application online, your card and documents will be sent to your address.
- I picked Japan Post Bank, because they would let me open a bank account with my working holiday visa, they have ATMs all over the country, and the application can be completed via their [account opening app](https://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/app/app_kouzakaisetu.html). They do come with unexpected drawbacks though, like [suspending services over golden week](https://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/news/2022/assets/pdf/information_en.pdf).


 *Now you’re mostly sorted you can…*


## 5. Look for a Permanent Address
- If you’re still in your temporary accommodation from the first step, it’s time to look for a more long-term solution.
- Once you’ve moved in, you need to inform the ward office about your move. If you are changing wards, you will need to go to your old ward office and tell them you’re moving out, then go to the new ward office and tell them you’re moving in.
- Now that you’ve gotten your residence card updated, you need to update your bank and mobile provider (and anyone else) with your new address.


## お疲れ様です![^1]
Congratulations, you’re now all sorted and ready to continue your Japan adventures.


[^1]: **‘Otsukaresamadesu’** is a commonly used Japanese phrase often translated as ‘Thanks for your work’ or ‘Great job!' Why not try using it when you come to Japan!</content>

    <content type="html">Recently, we had a piece of code that looked something like this:

~~~
has_one_attached :resumee
~~~

Does it look a little off to you? I’m sure you’ve seen (or even perpetrated) a scenario like this before, where you name something and when you revisit the code later you realise too late that you’ve made a typo.

We wanted to rename *resumee* to *resume*, but there was already data in the system. How do we ensure we don’t lose access to the existing *resumee* files when we rename the association?

Through googling I came across [How to rename an ActiveStorage has_one_attached association?](https://codigonomada.com/2022/08/18/how-to-rename-an-activestorage-has_one_attached-association/) — which was almost exactly what I wanted. But I wasn’t sure where I should be putting the fix. I don’t have access to the production box, so just running the query through the rails console wasn’t an option for me.

So, here’s a step by step guide on how I used a migration to fix the typo in the *has_one_attached* association.

- Run

~~~
rails generate migration RenameTableNameTypoedNameToFixedName
~~~

- Modify the migration file so it looks like this

~~~
class RenameTableNameTypoedNameToFixedName &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    ActiveStorage::Attachment
      .where(name: 'typoed_name', record_type: 'TableName')
      .update_all name: 'fixed_name'
  end
end
~~~

- Rename the attachment on the model
- Search your code for any uses of the typo and rename those too (don’t forget about comments, files, folders etc)

And you’re done!</content>

    <content type="html">The result of [TokyoDev's International Developers in Japan Survey 2022](/insights/2022-developer-survey) revealed that the country is still struggling to close the gender gap in the workplace in the tech industry.

As a Japanese woman and a mother of two children, I was very sad and also a little frustrated to see this result. Because it seemed to me that not much has changed in the 20 years since I started my career. It was also disappointing because the tech industry is usually regarded as one of Japan's most progressive industries, including the working environment and empowering women. So I was expecting the result to be much better.

In 2015, the government enacted the “[Act on the Promotion of Women's Active Engagement in Professional Life](https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/document?lawid=427AC0000000064)” to encourage women to pursue their career and to be offered equal opportunities regardless of their gender or age. It was a very good move to bridge the gender gap, but from my personal point of view, a lot of women (including myself) have always been enthusiastic to be “actively engaged in professional life”, even before such a law was introduced.

[As recently as my parents' generation](https://www.ipss.go.jp/syoushika/bunken/data/pdf/18740401.pdf), women were attending university at a radically lower rate than men: only 10% of women went to them compared to 40% of men. By my generation this had changed, with 50% of both genders attending university,  so we naturally expected to have the same level of equality after graduation. By the time I graduated from university in the early 2000s, some powerful women had paved the way and showed us how to be successful in our careers. Having those role models to follow after, I remember, I was very excited to start and grow my own career.

After I started working in a consulting firm in Tokyo, I seemed to be doing great. I was one of the top sales people, got a pay rise and a promotion before my male colleagues. I was very motivated to progress, and enthusiastic about my work and future career.
Many young women in Japan have a similar attitude to work to my own. [This survey](https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000195.000003638.html) conducted by Sony Life Insurance in 2020 shows 40.3% of women in their 20s and 41.4% in their 30s want to grow their careers. 

However, after getting married and having children, this seems to change drastically. [Another survey](https://www.gender.go.jp/research/kenkyu/hyakunen_r03.html) shows that among married women in their 20s and 30s, 17.3% became full time housewives, although only 8.5% of all respondents initially wanted to do so. And 27.5% answered that they prefer to be paid less, rather than to commit to working long hours or grow their career, because they want to spend more time at home to take care of their children and do housework.

According to the survey by the government in 2018, 46.9% of women left work after having their first child. Among those who left work, 52.3% answered that they did so because it was too hard for them to continue working while raising a child.  

I’m fully aware that in recent years, men are more involved in raising children and household chores than ever before. However, I’ve seen first-hand how most Japanese mothers still have so many responsibilities at home, that they can easily get overwhelmed and give up on their careers — and I was one of them.

From the moment I gave birth to my first child, I was incredibly determined to go back to work and catch up with my team. However, being both a mom and having a career proved extremely difficult.. I had to finish work before 17:00 to pick up my son by 18:00 even when all my colleagues were working until late at night to meet a big deadline. After getting home, I fed and bathed my son, then put him to sleep by myself since my husband was also working long hours everyday, and often stayed at the office overnight.

When my son got sick, I had to cancel all the meetings for the day to take care of him at home. When we had a family visiting us on weekends, I had to welcome them with some food prepared while my husband was rushing back from work.

Back then, it was hard to find a place that could take care of a sick child, and hiring a babysitter was too expensive. I couldn’t find anyone to help me handle the things that kept coming up one after another. I was always frustrated at never having enough time to get things done in the way I wanted, both at work and at home.

So, I gave up. I left work and decided to be a full-time mother.

The most common reason for women in their 20s not wanting to get married is because they don’t want to take on all those responsibilities, for working, raising children, doing housework and taking care of their own and their husband’s parents. 

In Japan, we have a [Family Registry System](https://jp.usembassy.gov/services/japans-family-registry-system/), which records all the family history and family relationships. When you marry, one of the spouses has to leave their family register and be added to their partner’s. It is not just about which surname you will have going forward, but, especially for parents, it’s more like “giving your child to another family”. And most of the time, women are the ones leaving their family. It is still very common for the older generation to literally say “We’ll give our daughter to your family” when they allow their daughter to marry someone.

Furthermore, if you marry the first son of the family, you might be pressured to give birth to a son to keep the family line going, since the heir to the family is always a man.

Because of this cultural background, marriage has been a larger family matter, and not only between husband and wife. I’ve seen it’s changing lately, but it is still true that there’s unspoken pressure for a wife to be a good daughter to her parents-in-law. It is not surprising to see a wife taking care of her husband’s elderly parents on behalf of their biological children, but it’s very rare that the husband takes care of the wife’s parents.

While being aware of these cultural expectations and unspoken pressures, 24% of unmarried women in their 20s answered that they don’t want to have children in the future. They know if they have children, they will face these kinds of responsibilities and pressures, which would make it difficult for them to focus on their careers, and ultimately make them choose between career and family.

However, the aging population and labor shortage caused by it are serious issues in Japan, with [51.1% of companies suffering a shortage of workers](https://www.tdb-di.com/special-planning-survey/sp20221130.php). Having more women continue their careers after marriage or childbirth is a key to solving this problem. To encourage them to work, it’s necessary to make it easier for them to better balance their work and family life.

The Japanese government is trying to make it easier for mothers, something that is nice to see. For example, they are pushing companies to encourage parents (especially fathers) to [take childcare leave](/articles/paternity-leave-in-japan) and [providing discount coupons for the use of babysitters](/articles/discount-coupons-for-babysitters-in-japan-via-a-government-subsidy). The shortage of nurseries was also a big issue that prevented many mothers from going back to work after maternity leave. However, this has also been improving with [less than 3,000 children on the waitlist](https://www.tdb-di.com/special-planning-survey/sp20221130.php) compared to 26,081 children on the waitlist In 2017. 

From a perspective of offering more options to full-time working mothers, it looks like Japan is moving in the right direction. However, many women still [prefer to work part-time](https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/kodomo_seisaku_kyouka/dai4/sankou1.pdf) with less responsibilities than to be regularly employed and work full-time. More than 2 million women answered they chose a part-time job because it’s easier to balance with housework, childcare and elderly care. 

Before having more women actively engaged in professional life, there seems to be a long way to go. It is a very complex problem, with the gender gap in the workplace, lack of government support and the cultural background. However, we shouldn’t waste much more time because we’d have [an economic loss of 1.17 trillion yen a year](https://www.dlri.co.jp/pdf/ld/2018/news1808.pdf) if 200,000 mothers leave work after childbirth. We can see how enormous an impact women can have on our economy.

Upon writing this article, I got to know that I was not alone and many other women also gave up on their career regardless of their motivations, talents or skills. 20 years ago, we had some role models who taught us how to build our career as a woman, but now I realize that we didn’t have one to teach us how we could be a successful working mother without a career break.

I think we’ve had enough struggles, frustration and sometimes tears in the past 20 years, and we don’t want younger generations to have the same experiences. I believe that the situation is improving (even though it's slower than we wished), and there are companies that take initiatives at [supporting and empowering women](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/supporting-communities-women-technology) like TokyoDev, so I do hope they can have both their career and family without giving up anything.

    <title>A Guide to Salary Negotiations in Japan’s Tech Industry </title>

    <content type="html">When it comes to salary negotiations in Japan’s tech industry, I’ve been on both sides of the table. I’ve worked as a recruiter sourcing candidates from around the world for a Japanese autonomous driving tech company, and have helped hundreds of English-speaking expats in secure tech jobs as the Career Support Lead at a coding bootcamp in Tokyo.

Through this I’ve seen how many individuals can be unaware of the cultural differences between salary negotiation in Japan and elsewhere, and end up doing something that’s perceived as unusual or even offensive. This article seeks to prevent such cultural misunderstandings, and will give you the tools necessary to negotiate your salary in Japan.

## When do I negotiate my salary in Japan?

In Japan, it’s common to be asked what your desired salary is during the initial HR screening. It might seem like this is the time to negotiate, convincing your interviewer to offer you your desired salary. This is a mistake though, as the purpose of asking is largely for the company to make sure time is not wasted on candidates that they cannot afford to hire. Trying to convince the interviewer to commit to your salary expectations at this stage will only sour the conversation - I’ve seen first hand how it can make a conversation go from great to terrible.

Instead, the best moment to negotiate your salary is at the final stage, once you have received your job offer. If you have received a verbal offer, wait to receive a written one (or request one from the company). Having written proof of your offer increases your chances of success in the negotiation. With tangible materials to support your case, you can make a stronger argument, as information conveyed verbally can sometimes be misinterpreted, especially when communicating with non-native speakers.

## Should I even tell the company my current or desired salary?

You may have seen negotiating advice to “never give your number first”.  While omitting your current or desired salary may work when speaking to large multinationals, it becomes more difficult with Japanese companies, who may require this information to move forward. 

To prepare for this, I recommend checking the salary range specified in the job description before your interview. I then suggest you initially apply the approach of not disclosing your number and observing the response. For instance, I would say something like “I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity, and I'm eager to learn more about the position and the team. If it's alright, I would appreciate the chance to discuss this topic further at a later stage in the process.” 

If the company persists though, you may want to share your salary expectations to move the process forward. When doing so, it's important that the number you provide is not your absolute minimum desired salary, as this will allow you to stay close to your goal, even if the company negotiates for something lower. A tactful response could be, "I'm looking for about [Number] Yen, but I'm open to discussing this further once I've had the opportunity to meet the team and learn more about the role."

## Preparing for the final negotiations 

Now that you have received a written job offer, it's time to prepare for the next steps. You may wonder, "What exactly am I preparing for?" In Japan, it is customary to have an offer meeting,known as naitei mendan (内定面談) or offer mendan (オファー面談), following the receipt of a job offer. While in other countries, negotiations may be done over email or by phone, I’ve noticed that in the tech industry in Japan companies that interview only in English tend to be open to negotiating by email, while Japanese-only may not be. The best option would be to simply send an email to ask, “I have some questions about the job offer including the compensation. Could I ask them by email or shall we set up a meeting?”

One similarity I have noticed among successful negotiators is that they don’t make money the main subject of discussion. Rather, when the candidate asks for an increase in salary, they keep the focus on the level of impact they are going to make  in the company. This helps as Japanese people tend to be less direct when it comes to speaking about money.

Having this in mind, the next step I recommend is to gather evidence that answer the following: 

1. Why has the company decided to give you this particular offer? Why this compensation?
2. What is your role? What is your level of seniority? And why?
3. What problems do they want you to solve in the first few months of being there? What skills and knowledge do you have that help them do this?

After you have gathered evidence from your interview process, the next step is to do market research. Fortunately, there is an increasing amount of information about salaries in Japan's tech industry, such as the following:

* TokyoDev's data on [software developer salaries in Japan](/articles/software-developer-salaries-in-japan)
* [OpenSalary](https://opensalary.jp/roles/software-engineer)
* [Project Comp](https://project-comp.com)
* [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/)

## Recruiters don't necessarily want to maximize your salary

If you are working with an agent from a recruitment agency, they may do the final salary negotiation on your behalf. How effectively they represent you though will depend on the agent and the relationship you’ve built up with them.

When I was working in HR, I would have recruiters ask if we could increase the offer of a candidate they were representing. When we declined, many would simply say, “I understand. I’ll negotiate with the candidate so please hold on.” Keep in mind that with recruiters, the company is the one paying them, so if you would like them to effectively negotiate your compensation, you need to give them a good reason to do so.

## Negotiating with *Wa*

Once you have gathered evidence and done your market research, it’s finally time to negotiate. You will most likely do this over email or during an offer meeting. If you are going to have an offer meeting, it is typically conducted by the HR or someone who understands your role. The best approach is to find out in advance who they will be. 

As mentioned above, an important principle when negotiating your compensation is to not become adversarial, where you are ‘fighting’ to get what you want. It’s vital to remember concepts like harmony (wa), hospitality with the ability to anticipate concerns (omotenashi), and continuous improvement (kaizen) which lie at the foundation of Japanese society. I recommend you adjust your language to reflect these 3 elements. For example, instead of saying “I deserve [Number] JPY because I have the proven experience and knowledge in ….”, adjust to something like,

“I understand the team is aiming to [goal], which I feel confident I can contribute to with my knowledge of [something]. From what I’ve learned during the interview process, my experience in [detail] can also help solve the problem of [detail]. I’m committed to your company’s cause and would appreciate it if you could increase the offered salary to [Number].”

In addition to your compensation, there are also other things that you can negotiate on: 

* Start date
* Job title
* Your responsibilities (For example, how much development you will do vs. management)
* Stock options

It’s not common in Japan to negotiate on your paid leave, as companies normally have a standardized system for all employees. Additionally, some job seekers in the past have asked me about the possibility of negotiating the health insurance package, but this is uniformly set for all employees hence is not negotiable.

Here are additional tips:

* The act of negotiating will help you become a better professional, so don’t judge your success just on the immediate outcome.
* Show excitement and passion about joining the team. Logic is not the only thing that moves people.
* Be thankful. Begin the conversation or email with, “Thank you for your time and support throughout this interview process”. You’d be surprised how few candidates show gratitude.
* This isn’t the last time you will get a chance to negotiate. If now is not the time, shift focus to setting grounds for future negotiation opportunities. 

## The waiting game

After completing your negotiation, the next step is to embrace the waiting game. Typically, the company will get back to you within a few days to share if they can meet your requests. If you're still juggling interviews with other companies, you might be able to speed up their decision-making process by leveraging the offer you have while you wait. 

## Leveraging another job offer

Should you receive another offer from a different company, it's wise to notify the first company right away. If the salary offered from another job opportunity aligns more closely with your desired goal, it could potentially be used as leverage to negotiate a higher salary in the initial offer. So, how do you do it? To begin with, ideally, you would have already mentioned during the interview stage that you've been interviewing with other companies. If you haven't, or if you've kept it a secret, there are implications to think about. Abruptly using another offer to achieve your desired outcome may come across  as exploitative, dishonest, and could sour your relationship with the prospective employer. While it’s rare for a company to retract their offer, your communication during this stage will establish the foundation for your future working relationship with them so decide wisely. If you decide to use the other offer, send an email to the first company to let them know about your situation. Here’s an example,

“Thank you again for the opportunity to speak with your team. I’m letting you know I’ve just received another offer from a company with an offer of [Number]. However, I am still very much interested in working at [Company Name] and being part of the team. If there is any chance to match this offer, I would be thrilled to accept it immediately.” 

If the company can revise the offer, you'll receive an updated version of it, typically within a couple of days. Take a moment to review the revised offer and make sure that you are in agreement with its terms. Although it’s uncommon for candidates to negotiate multiple times with a company, this is a crucial phase to decide what your next chapter in your career is going to look like. If there is something you’re not sure about or you’re not 100% confident on, ask immediately.

## Conclusion

Negotiating your salary as an English speaker in the tech industry in Japan may feel understandably challenging as you’re trying to figure out the best tone of voice in a cultural context that may be different from what you’re used to.

Key Takeaways:

1. Understand the appropriate timing: Avoid negotiating salary during the initial HR screening. Wait until you receive a written job offer to begin negotiations.
2. Tactful salary disclosure: Focus on expressing enthusiasm and eagerness to learn more, and consider sharing salary expectations if necessary.
3. Shift your mindset: View negotiation as an opportunity for the company to invest in you and focus on showcasing the value you can bring to the team.
4. Gather evidence: Collect evidence supporting why the company made the offer, their expectations for your role, and the problems they want you to solve. Do market research so you know what the industry standard is.
5. Maintain a positive and harmonious approach: Reflect concepts like "wa" (harmony), "omotenashi" (hospitality), and "kaizen" (continuous improvement) during negotiations.
6. Be thankful and look ahead: Express gratitude for the opportunity and remember that negotiation is not the last chance. Set the groundwork for future negotiation opportunities and be open to future discussions.

My grandmother often shared a quote by Uesugi Yozan, saying, "為せば成る、為さねば成らぬ、何事も、成らぬは人の為さぬなりけり," which translates to, "If you do, it will be done; if you don't do it, it won't be done; whatever you don't do, it is because you didn't do it." This quote holds a powerful truth: if you don’t ask for what you want, you will never know if it could have been yours. Remember, taking action is the crucial first step towards achieving your goals. Best of luck on your journey!</content>

Babysitters are very expensive in Japan for most families, so it’s usually not an option for many parents. But at the same time, many parents often have trouble when [their young child gets sick, has a fever, or during long school holidays](https://www.dik.or.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/P_jyoseinoshigototokosodate_.pdf) needing to find someone who takes care of their children while they go to work. 

In order to make babysitters more accessible to more parents, the government started issuing e-ticket coupons. However, as it’s called “Company-led support program for babysitter users”,  the coupons are not directly sent to the parents. All the support is only provided through their employer company, and the company must be registered in advance. 

Since I went through all the procedures to get TokyoDev registered so that our founder Paul can use the coupons for his children, I’d like to share how you can apply and get the coupons issued.

Like other online systems by the Japanese government, the system itself is not very user friendly unfortunately, but still it would be worth bothering if you have employees with young children.

A coupon gives a ¥2,200 discount, and parents can use 2 coupons for each child per day, 24 coupons per month and 280 coupons per year. This means that parents could save at maximum of ¥4,400 per day, ¥52,800 per month and ¥616,000 per year for each child while the company would only need to cover at maximum of ¥19,600 per year per child, having the rest covered by the government.

Anyone is eligible to receive the coupons if they 

* are employed by a registered company.
* have children under age of the third-grade of elementary school (9 years old) or sixth-grade of elementary school (under 12 years old) with some special care required.
* are under employee’s pension insurance (厚生年金保険の被保険者), which includes the CEO and directors of the company.

The coupons can be used the parents need a babysitter to take care of their children so that they can do their work. These coupons can be used with [specific companies that accept them](http://www.acsa.jp/htm/babysitter/ticket_handling_list.htm). The babysitting service is limited to childcare at home, though the sitter is allowed to pick up and drop off the kids from their daycare.

To get the company registered, you just need to fill out the basic company information [here](https://reg18.smp.ne.jp/regist/is?SMPFORM=napd-lfshpf-f2ff061523710fdda33a50bfcc395f9f). The information required is pretty basic, and it should only take about five minutes. About 10 days later, you'll receive an email with the information you need to access their system site (割引券管理サイト).

![Screenshot of the system site](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTY5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1eb9b2285ff8d039a9790af5e0c3ff47a82c7124/system-site.png)

On the page to apply for coupons (割引券申込), you can decide how many coupons you’d like to be issued. Right after you apply, you receive an email with an  invoice for ¥70 of non-refundable fee (手数料) per coupon  (¥180 for companies with more than 1000 employees), so it may be a good idea to ask around the employees to get a rough idea how many you should apply for first.

On the next day you pay the invoice, you find coupons are issued on their system. It is an e-ticket with URL, so you can copy each URL and share it with the employees. Make sure the employees will let you know when they used the coupons so that you can mark it as “used” on the system.

After you and your employees consume 80% of all the already issued coupons, you can apply for additional coupons. When applying, be careful that there’s a limit you can apply for. If your company has less than 1,000 employees, the limit per each application is 100 coupons, and 1,200 coupons in a year. Also note that the issued coupons are only valid for the fiscal year, so they need to be used by the end of March.

It may sound a little complicated, but the procedure itself is relatively simple and doesn’t require much time. Once you get registered as a user company, it doesn’t require too much effort to manage these, so if you have employees with young children, I recommend you consider taking advantage of this program, and give them extra childcare support. 

Or, if you are a parent yourself and desperately need a babysitter even just for a couple of hours sometimes, don’t hesitate to ask your company to get these coupons!</content>

    <author>
      <name>Mary Grygjeanne Grace Icay</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">I've already talked about some [tips on how to land a job in Japan](https://medium.com/japonica-publication/tips-for-landing-a-job-in-japan-b1b94315f177), as well as some [job sites](https://todorokis.medium.com/job-hunting-websites-to-get-an-it-job-in-japan-c7516846ce5) that I've used or heard about to apply in applying for QA Engineer positions..

In this article, I'll dive deeper into the interview preparation part by sharing some questions that I was commonly asked and giving advice about how you can prepare for them. Although I’m sharing this from my perspective as a QA Engineer, much of this advice is generally applicable for tech interviews in Japan.

## My own experience interviewing for a tech job in Japan

Job hunting is a painfully arduous process. Out of the 80+ applications I remember sending, I was able to land around 30 or so interviews. Less than ten of those landed me a second interview, and as my patience was starting to wear thin, I finally got a job offer from the company that I’m working for now.

All of those seem to be just statistics now—it’s a numbers game after all—but at that time, it was dizzying. I wasn’t that picky with the type of company or the job title, but I did want something that aligned with my career path. So I applied for positions such as QA Engineer, QA Lead, Software Engineer in Test (SET), Software Developer in Test (SDET), Tech Lead, Test Engineer, Bridge Software Engineer, and R&amp;D Engineer. This was despite recruiters trying to force me to go back to being a Software Developer even when I clearly stated my career goal of getting a position relating to QA.

I tried applying to almost any type of companies you could think of—Fintech, IT Solutions, Human Resources, Video Streaming, AI, Crypto, Ed Tech, Mobility Solutions, Inhouse Software Development, Testing, Robotics, Real Estate—all of them. I also applied to big companies, but most of my applications have been focused on startups, mainly because I wanted to be able to feel my contributions actually affecting the company. It was a different kind of challenge, knowing that for most companies I applied to, there was no existing QA team.

Off the top of my head, 70% of the interviews I did were conducted in Japanese, 25% in English, and 5% was a mix of both. Despite being extroverted and multilingual, I still found myself grasping for straws trying to explain technical terminologies in Japanese. As if coming up with the words to describe myself and my work ethic wasn’t difficult enough to do in English, doing it in Japanese without some kind of template to follow gave me such a rough time that I had wished I had a more concrete guide to follow.


## The Interviewing Process

There are usually around 2-3 rounds of interviews for most tech companies--the first being the introductory part, where the applicant introduces themselves and the company also gives the applicant an idea of what they're looking for in an applicant. With this interview, there are normally 1-2 people joining the call.

The second interview is usually technically focused, where the interviewer will ask questions that are specific to the job role. In some cases, they would require a coding exam (usually timed and mostly using online testing software) and then have a call scheduled after that to ask you more in-depth questions regarding your answers and why you chose to use a specific approach.

Sometimes there's something called a "Culture fit" interview where the company would try to see if it's easy for you to adjust to the company culture and work with the existing teams, but this is quite rare.

There are also cases where the HR would conduct interviews to ask you about visa status, expectations, etc., and talk to you about the company's perks so that you're typically on the same page with the company. This doesn't ensure that you'll be getting a job offer, but in most cases, this usually means that they are considering giving you a job offer.

Lastly, there's the "job offer" portion, where they would discuss the annual salary they would like to offer you if you will be taking the position. In Japanese job boards, the salary range for the position is often included, so it's easier to keep a certain range minimum and maximum range in mind before going into this part of the interview.

However, if the offer doesn't meet your expectations, it's still okay to have a discussion with the company and negotiate your salary. You should have three numbers in mind: the minimum amount you're actually willing to accept for the job, the maximum salary that is initially offered, and something that's a little in-between your maximum expectation and the company's offer to ensure that you're not being low-balled.

## Etiquette and Dress Code

But first of all, some tips regarding interview etiquette.

Nowadays, companies have adopted the online video-conferencing style of doing interviews instead of having applicants go to their offices. Of course, this is much more convenient for everyone involved, but it's still important to look like you've dressed up and prepared for this interview.

I'm not saying you should go out and rent a three-piece suit, but something of a business casual or smart casual would do.

Look presentable. Ensure your clothes are ironed and there aren't any loose threads, stains, or missing buttons on the clothes that you're wearing to the interview.

You don't have to get a haircut just for an interview, but looking neat is a helpful bonus. If you have long hair, tie it up so it doesn't look like a mess.

Especially in more traditional companies, they observe your conduct when walking to and from the venue and how you present yourself to the interviewers. This is on a much smaller scale for online interviews since you're typically just appearing on-screen.

Of course, the golden rule of all job interviews is to always be on time. For me, I typically opened the interview meeting room link 5 minutes before the call so I can just check that everything is looking okay on my end.

Make sure that you are in a quiet room and that all your peripherals (e.g. headset, webcam, etc) are working properly beforehand so that you don't have to waste time troubleshooting in the middle of the interview.

A nice tip that someone shared with me is that you have to always be centered in the video while still creating some distance between you and the camera, typically showing the area right around your shoulders. This is so that you don't look too big or too small in the video output.

Just like in face-to-face conversations, make sure that you maintain eye contact with the interviewer and that your eyes don't roam around the room.

## General Questions

These are questions that I typically encountered for all of the companies and positions that I applied for, so it would be helpful to prepare for these questions, especially for the first interview.

### 1. **Self-introduction （自己紹介)**
Not all companies require you to speak in Japanese, but it's definitely a plus if you can converse in Japanese, or at least introduce yourself in Japanese.

Don’t make your introduction too long and only emphasize the important parts, like your name, where you’re from, how long you’ve been in Japan, and your current role. Around 2-3 sentences should be sufficient for this.

### 2. Reason for applying for a new job（転職理由）
If you're trying to leave your current company because of bad working conditions or a toxic work environment, make sure to never mention this in the interview. This may come off as rude and you might just look like you're complaining. It may also give the interviewer the impression that since you're freely badmouthing your previous or current employer, then you might start badmouthing them too once you leave the job.

In my case, I mentioned that I wanted to skill up and explore more opportunities for myself that weren't specific to the product that I was testing currently.

### 3. Reason for wanting to join the company（志望理由）
It's important to check out the company's website and social media pages to get an idea of what the company values are. In most cases, companies have a "Vision" and "Mission" page. It would be great if you could align your personal goals with these vision and mission points.

### 4. Your strong points（得意ポイント）
It’s important to base your strong points off of the list of qualifications provided in the Job Description. Having around three strong points to differentiate you from other applicants is a good advantage to have

### 5. Your weak points（苦手なポイント）
Of course we all have our weaknesses, but don’t highlights ones that are crucial to the position you’re applying for. It also helps to soften the blow by adding how you’re working on improving your weak points by studying, getting mentored, etc.

### 6. What are your career goals?

How do you visualize your career path going forward? If you think the company could help you achieve your goals, you can also mention that.

### 7. What have you accomplished since you started your career?

It’s not necessarily about certifications, but also how you helped your current or previous companies with their internal processes, etc. You can also mention projects that you’ve participated in.

### 8. Tell us about your current job
Most companies (especially those who are looking to hire Mid-Senior Levels) are looking for applicants who already have the years of experience related to the technology their company is using. Make sure to familiarize the contents of your resume itself to support how you’ll be answering this question.

### 9. Why did you previously switch jobs?
This is usually only asked if they see in your records that you’ve previously made a job switch. As I said previously in the “Reason for applying for a new job” section, you should never badmouth your previous company.

### 10. Failures that you have experienced at work

Of course it’s not always possible to bring 100% at work. For this section, you could bring up one instance where the weakness that you mentioned at an earlier point of the interview could be the cause, but also make sure to mention how you were able to resolve this. Japanese companies also take into consideration how you’ll be able to work alongside their current employees (a culture fit, if you will), so if you’ve received help from your boss or coworker, it’s important to highlight how teamwork served you in this scenario. Just make sure that the experience you will be mentioning is not detrimental to the company in any way

### 11. What did you learn from your time in college?

This is usually asked for fresh graduates, so even if you’re not part of your classes top rankings, you could mention values that you’ve learned and projects that you’ve worked on, especially if you’ve also been working on side projects.

### 12. How would you contribute to the company?

Aside from the gap in the company’s workforce, of course they also want to have employees that could give contributions to the company’s process. You don’t have to be applying for a leadership position to help implement constructive changes in the company, but you shouldn’t also be forcing changes down their throats. You could also consider mentioning how you can help out teammates that are stuck and communicating with the team in order to create a seamless workflow, among others.

### 13. How many companies are you applying for right now?

If you’re in the interviewing stage with other companies, it would be good to mention that to them so that they could speed up the interview process for you in case they’re considering you as a candidate.

### 14. What would make you accept a job offer?

Usually a follow-up to the previous question, but you could bring up a good point that the company currently has for this portion.

### 15. What do you think our company can offer you?

Usually, companies who ask this question are startups, so you don’t usually need to worry about this question coming up for bigger companies. However, if you do want to work at a startup, a good point to bring up is that working for a startup (especially one that’s just at its beginning stages) could give you more room to contribute to the company and see actual changes being implemented.

### 16. Is there anything you want to ask?

Always come prepared to ask them a question. This shows that you are actually interested in the company that you’re applying for. If you’ve seen any gaps in the information they have posted on their website, you can ask them about those. It doesn’t have to be complicated, but if the information could already be found in the job posting, don’t ask them that question again since it’s already been provided to you.

## Final Words

It’s so hard to find a job these days, no matter the number of years of experience you have under your belt or your fluency in the language. The same sentiment was true back when I lived in my home country, and the same is still true now that I moved to a country miles away from home, whose culture I’m still trying to navigate around.

The entire process can be taxing physically and mentally, so it’s important to have a circle of people who have your best interests at heart.

I’m glad that there are welcoming communities like [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com) which has a group of people who are glad to be of help giving interview advice, resume reviews, and cheering you on.

    <content type="html">Understanding what software salaries developer in Japan are be tricky. As a whole, software development doesn’t pay exceptionally well: according to [a 2022 survey](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00450091&amp;tstat=000001011429&amp;cycle=0&amp;tclass1=000001202310&amp;tclass2=000001202312&amp;tclass3=000001202329&amp;tclass4val=0) conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan found, the average annual salary of software engineers in Japan is ¥5.2 million. This puts it a bit above the overall average salary of ¥4.6 million.

At the same time though, TokyoDev’s own survey of English-speaking international software developers in Japan found that the [median salary of respondents was ¥9.5 million](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary). This difference stems from our respondents being anything but typical. For instance, [63% of them](/insights/2022-developer-survey#employer-type) worked at a company headquartered in Japan, [82% of them](/insights/2022-developer-survey#language-usage) used English frequently, and [86% of them](/insights/2022-developer-survey#team-nationalities) worked on an engineering team where many of the members were non-Japanese.

This makes answering the question of what is a reasonable software developer salary in Japan difficult. If you were a “typical” Japanese software developer with three years of experience, a salary of ¥4 million may sound reasonable. And yet if you ask the international developers on [TokyoDev’s Discord](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV) if the offer is reasonable, you’re likely to be told it is on the low side and you can probably do better.

So with that in mind, I think it’s important to get an overview of the market both for exceptional English-speaking international software developers, and typical Japanese ones. This article will compare TokyoDev's own findings about software engineer salaries, with that of other Japanese sources.

## Trends in Compensation for Software Developers in Japan

Since the first comprehensive survey TokyoDev conducted in 2019, salaries have been trending significantly upward, with the median increasing from ¥7.0 million to ¥9.5 million (a 36% increase) between 2019 and 2022.

One factor that may partially explain this is a small but noticeable drop in the number of respondents working for Japanese headquartered companies, from 70% in 2019 to 63% in 2022. As we've found that [international subsidiaries and companies without Japanese entities tend to pay better](#salary-by-type-of-company), a higher percentage of respondents working for them should boost the median compensation of respondents.

| Year | Median Compensation |
|-|-|
| [2022](https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary) | ¥9.5 million |
| [2021](https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2021-developer-survey#salary) | ¥8.5 million |
| [2020](https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2020-developer-survey#salary) | ¥7.5 million |
| [2019](https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/01/07/japan-developer-salaries) | ¥7.0 million |

### Comparison: The Wage Structure Basic Statistical Survey

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan conducts the Wage Structure Basic Statistical Survey annually. While this survey is [not without flaws](http://www.crepe.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/results/2022/CREPEDP115.pdf), it does collect data on a massive scale, having most recently collected approximately six hundred thousand respondents who are classified as “software creators” ([defined as](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/classifications/terms/20/02/104) those engaged in specification determination, design, and programming work for software creation).

The survey found that the average compensation of software creators increased from ¥4.8 million to ¥5.2 million (an 8% increase) between 2020 and 2022. While it is not as striking as our findings, it suggests that the market overall has been moving to increase the pay of software developers.

| Year | Mean Compensation |
|-|-|
| [2022](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00450091&amp;tstat=000001011429&amp;cycle=0&amp;tclass1=000001202310&amp;tclass2=000001202312&amp;tclass3=000001202329&amp;tclass4val=0) | ¥5.2 million |
| [2021](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00450091&amp;tstat=000001011429&amp;cycle=0&amp;tclass1=000001152186&amp;tclass2=000001152187&amp;tclass3=000001152191&amp;tclass4val=0) | ¥4.8 million |
| [2020](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00450091&amp;tstat=000001011429&amp;cycle=0&amp;tclass1=000001152186&amp;tclass2=000001152187&amp;tclass3=000001152191&amp;tclass4val=0) | ¥4.8 million |

Unfortunately [data from 2019](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00450091&amp;tstat=000001011429&amp;cycle=0&amp;tclass1=000001138086&amp;tclass2=000001138089&amp;tclass3=000001138093&amp;tclass4val=0) and before isn't directly comparable, as there was no "software creator" classification, only a "programmer" one. As the mean compensation for programmers in 2019 was ¥3.9 million, it seems likely that the respondents themselves are quite different. Traditionally in Japan, the word "programmer" has referred to someone who's job it is to take a specification and turn it into code, without doing anything else (think the way software was written in [the punch card days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era)), so by that definition, it is no wonder they were paid less.

## Salary by Experience

Experience is one of the most important factors in determining your salary as a developer, and so looking at it can be a good place to start when you're trying to judge your value in the market. [We found](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-experience) that among junior developers (less than two years of experience), the median compensation was ¥5.5 million, while among senior developers (eight or more years of experience), the median rose to ¥12.5 million.

| Experience | Median Compensation |
| --- | --- |
| Under 2 years | ¥5.5 million |
| 2 - 3 years | ¥6.5 million |
| 4 - 5 years | ¥7.5 million |
| 6 - 7 years | ¥8.5 million |
| 8 - 9 years | ¥12.5 million |
| 10 - 11 years | ¥12.5 million |
| 12 - 13 years | ¥10 million |
| 14 - 15 years | ¥13 million |
| 16 years and over | ¥13.5 million |

### Comparison: The Wage Structure Basic Statistical Survey

The Wage Structure Basic Statistical Survey found that the mean compensation of software creators with no experience was merely ¥3.0 million, and even among those with 15 or more years of experience, the compensation was only ¥6.1 million.

Though their figures aren’t quite analogous to ours, as they don’t include compensation for overtime, and are mean as opposed to our median values, they do highlight just how different the “typical” compensation for software developers in Japan is compared to that of international developers.

| Experience | Mean Compensation |
| --- | --- |
| 0 years | ¥3.0 million |
| 1-4 years | ¥4.3 million |
| 5-9 years | ¥4.8 million |
| 10-14 years | ¥5.6 million |
| 15+ years | ¥6.2 million |

### Comparison: Qiita’s Engineer White Paper 2022

Qiita is a service that is popular among Japanese developers to record and share knowledge. Their [Engineer White Paper 2022](https://qiita.com/white_papers/2022) is based on a survey they conducted of their users, and has over 2,700 responses.

Their data is interesting as their audience is fairly analogous to TokyoDev, with the exception of being from Japanese not international developers. The kind of people who use their site are likely motivated engineers who care about their craft, and not just people who are doing it because their company decided they should do software development (Japanese companies have a history of assigning employees to be software developers regardless of interest or aptitude).

As their report shows what percentage of respondents fit into a given salary range, it is a bit hard to compare with our data. But it is apparent that their respondents made less than ours. For instance, while we found [42% of our respondents made ¥10 million or over](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary) (across all experience levels), only 11% of their respondents with 10+ years of experience did.

| Experience | Under ¥3M | ¥3M - ¥4.9M | ¥5M - ¥7.9M | ¥8M - ¥9.9M | ¥10M - ¥14.9M | ¥15M - ¥19.9M | ¥20M+ | No answer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| &lt;1 year | 42% | 44% | 6% | 1% | 2% | 0% | 0% | 5% |
| 1-2 years | 22% | 52% | 18% | 1% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 7% |
| 3-4 years | 12% | 47% | 30% | 6% | 1% | 0% | 1% | 4% |
| 5-9 years | 7% | 33% | 42% | 9% | 4% | 2% | &lt;1% | 2% |
| 10-19 years | 4% | 18% | 45% | 19% | 9% | 1% | 1% | 4% |
| 20 years+ | 6% | 18% | 41% | 20% | 9% | 1% | 1% | 5% |

## Salary by Age

In Japan, there has traditionally been lifetime employment, and as employees could expect their compensation to increase with seniority, it was also essentially tied to their age. When I first came to Japan, I heard the typical formula was age x ¥10,000 per month. So as a 23 year old, a salary of ¥230,000 per month would be typical.

At least among the kind of companies employing TokyoDev respondents though, I have the impression that age has less of a bearing than experience. I’m including our data for [salary by age](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-age) primarily as a way to compare with other Japanese sources.

| Age | Median |
| --- | --- |
| 20 - 24 | ¥5.5 million |
| 25 - 29 | ¥7.5 million |
| 30 - 34 | ¥9.5 million |
| 35 - 39 | ¥10.5 million |
| 40 - 44 | ¥10.5 million |
| 45 - 49 | ¥12.5 million |

### Comparison: Forkwell

[Forkwell](https://forkwell.com) offers a platform for Japanese software engineers looking to change jobs. They’ve released [a report](https://pr.forkwell.com/articles/annual-income-distribution-of-it-developers/) that analyzes the data of 10,000 registered users, including a salary breakdown based on age.

| Age | Median |
| --- | --- |
| 20 - 24 | ¥4.2 million |
| 25 - 29 | ¥4.7 million |
| 30 - 34 | ¥5.3 million |
| 35 - 39 | ¥6.0 million |
| 40 - 44 | ¥6.5 million |
| 45 - 49 | ¥7.0 million |

Again, our respondents consistently made more than theirs. The gap was least pronounced among the youngest respondents, with ours having a median 31% more than theirs, but among the 30-34 year old respondents, the median salary of our respondents was 79% more than theirs.

## Salary by Gender

We found that across all experience levels, [women were compensated worse then men](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-gender), and that the percentage of respondents that were women decreased with experience, while the wage gap widened.

| Experience | Men | Women | Women Respondents | Wage gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Under 3 years | ¥6 million | ¥5.5 million | 15% | 8% |
| 3 - 5 years | ¥7.5 million | ¥6.5 million | 12% | 13% |
| 6 - 8 years | ¥10.5 million | ¥8 million | 9% | 24% |
| 9 years and over | ¥12.5 million | ¥9 million | 5% | 28% |

Furthermore, we found that women developers [rated themselves as less satisfied](/insights/2022-developer-survey#satisfaction-by-gender) with their job then men. That being said, from talking with [female developers in Japan](/articles/working-as-a-female-software-developer-in-japan), we’ve found that many of them do have fulfilling careers here.

### Comparison: The Wage Structure Basic Statistical Survey

The [Wage Structure Basic Statistical Survey](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00450091&amp;tstat=000001011429&amp;cycle=0&amp;tclass1=000001202310&amp;tclass2=000001202312&amp;tclass3=000001202329&amp;tclass4val=0) provides a breakdown of compensation by experience and gender.

The wage gap between men and women was relatively small among unexperienced respondents, perhaps owing to how Japanese companies offer standardized compensation packages to new grads. The wage gap continued to widen, till it reached its peak at 5-9 years of experience. After that in continued to shrink again.

While 30% of software developers with less than a year of experience were women, the percentage that was women shrunk with experience. Among respondents with 15+ years of experience, only 12% were women.

| Experience | Men | Women | Women Respondents | Wage Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 years | ¥3.0 million | ¥2.9 million | 30% | 3% |
| 1-4 years | ¥4.5 million | ¥3.9 million | 23% | 13% |
| 5-9 years | ¥5.1 million | ¥4.0 million | 22% | 22% |
| 10-14 years | ¥5.8 million | ¥4.9 million | 16% | 16% |
| 15+ years | ¥6.3 million | ¥5.4 million | 12% | 14% |

My theory is that the reversal in the wage gap and the sharp drop in the percentage of women respondents is connected. Women who are poorly compensated compared to their male counterparts are more likely to leave the industry. So through attrition only the better compensated women remain at higher experience levels.

### Comparison: Forkwell

Forkwell worked with [bgrass](https://bgrass.co.jp), an organization working to close the gender gap in tech, to conduct [a survey of 311 male and 126 female engineers](https://pr.forkwell.com/articles/earnings-gap-for-itengineers-2/). The survey measured “theoretical annual income”, calculated by deriving the hourly wage of an engineer from their average annual income, the number of working days per week, and the working hours per day, and then converting it into an annual income figure assuming full-time work.

Their data paints a similar picture to The Wage Structure Basic Statistical Survey, where women in the middle of their career have the biggest wage gap. Only 27% of women with 5-9 years of experience made more than ¥5 million, while 47% of men did.

      &lt;td&gt;18%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In addition to experience, they also explored how the kind of company a women works at affects the wage gap, and found that outsourcing companies had a particularly large gender gap when compared to those that made their own IT/Web service. In these outsourcing companies only 11% of women made more than ¥5 million, while 39% of men did.

      &lt;td&gt;5%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

## Salary by Type of Company

One reason why our respondents have such higher pay than other sources is [the type of company they worked for](/insights/2022-developer-survey#employer-type). Notably, 26% worked for a subsidiary of an international company, and 8% for a company without any legal entity in Japan. It seems obvious to me that it is much higher than that for the overall market for software engineers (though I didn’t find any data to back this).

This is significant as we found that the median compensation of respondents at internationally headquartered companies was almost twice of that of domestically headquartered ones!

| Company Type | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Company without Japanese entity | ¥11.5 million | ¥8.5 million | ¥10.5 million |
| International subsidiary | ¥14.5 million | ¥11.5 million | ¥9 million |
| Japanese company | ¥7.5 million | ¥7.5 million | ¥6.5 million |
| Sole Proprietorship | ¥7 million | ¥6.5 million | ¥8.5 million |

Companies headquartered in Japan paid developers a median of ¥6.5 million per year in 2020, and ¥7.5 million in 2022. On the other hand, over the same time period, Japanese subsidiaries of international companies went from paying ¥9 million to ¥14.5 million. So they went from paying 38% more to 93% more in a period of two years!

Our latest survey was conducted in October 2022. Since then, there have been mass layoffs at many US tech companies, so it will be interesting to see how this changes with our next survey.

## Salary by Employer Size

We found that with the exception of the smallest employers, [salaries increased with the number of employees](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-employer-size) at the employer. Respondents at companies with 10-19 employees had a median compensation of ¥6.5 million, while those at 10,000 or more had a median of ¥13.5 million.

| Employees | Median Compensation |
| --- | --- |
| 2 to 9 employees | ¥7.5 million |
| 10 to 19 employees | ¥6.5 million |
| 20 to 99 employees | ¥7.5 million |
| 100 to 499 employees | ¥7.5 million |
| 500 to 999 employees | ¥9.5 million |
| 1,000 to 4,999 employees | ¥10.5 million |
| 5,000 to 9,999 employees | ¥12.5 million |
| 10,000 or more employees | ¥13.5 million |

### Comparison: The Wage Structure Basic Statistical Survey

The [Wage Structure Basic Statistical Survey](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00450091&amp;tstat=000001011429&amp;cycle=0&amp;tclass1=000001202310&amp;tclass2=000001202312&amp;tclass3=000001202329&amp;tclass4val=0) also found that compensation increased with employee count. Respondents at companies with 1000 employees or more made on average 47% more than those at companies with 10 - 99 employees.

| Employee Count | Average Compensation |
| --- | --- |
| 1000 employees and over | ¥6.3 million |
| 100 - 999 employees | ¥5.0 million |
| 10 - 99 employees | ¥4.3 million |

## Salary by Role

We found that respondents who worked as Senior Executives or Engineering Managers were [had the highest compensation](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-role). This can be explained in part by them having the most experience. Respondents who had the Designer role stood out as they had among the lowest compensation while having above average experience.

| Role | Median Compensation |
| --- | --- |
| Blockchain | ¥12.0 million |
| Cloud infrastructure engineer | ¥10.0 million |
| Data or business analyst | ¥10.5 million |
| Data scientist or ML specialist | ¥8.5 million |
| Database administrator | ¥8.5 million |
| Designer | ¥6.5 million |
| DevOps specialist | ¥10.5 million |
| Developer, back-end | ¥8.5 million |
| Developer, desktop or enterprise | ¥8.5 million |
| Developer, embedded | ¥7.5 million |
| Developer, front-end | ¥8 million |
| Developer, full-stack | ¥7.5 million |
| Developer, game or graphics | ¥6.5 million |
| Developer, mobile | ¥10 million |
| Developer, QA or test | ¥8.5 million |
| Engineer, data | ¥9.5 million |
| Engineer, site reliability | ¥11.0 million |
| Engineering manager | ¥13.5 million |
| Product manager | ¥8.5 million |
| Senior executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.) | ¥15.5 million |
| Security professional | ¥12.5 million |
| System administrator | ¥8.5 million |

### Comparison: Robert Half

The recruiting company Robert Half publishes [a salary guide](https://www.roberthalf.jp/en/salary-guide/specialisation/technology) for software engineering positions in Japan, and weren’t so significantly different than ours. As they target bilingual people working for higher paying roles, this isn’t surprising.

| Role | Median compensation |
| --- | --- |
| Back End Engineer | ¥8.3 million |
| Blockchain Engineer | ¥8.3 million |
| Cloud Engineer / Architect | ¥8.3 million |
| CTO / VP of Engineering | ¥13.5 million |
| DevOps / SRE Engineer | ¥9.3 million |
| Engineering Manager | ¥12.5 million |
| Front End Engineer | ¥8.3 million |
| Full Stack Engineer | ¥8.3 million |
| Machine Learning / NLP / AI Engineer | ¥10 million |
| Product Manager / Software Architect | ¥9.4 million |
| QA Engineer / Tester | ¥7.3 million |
| Solution Engineer | ¥9.3 million |
| IT / UX Designer | ¥7.3 million |

## Salary by Educational Background

While having a computer science or related degree is helpful for [getting a visa in Japan](/articles/japanese-engineering-visa-options), it doesn’t seem to be [so relevant in terms of compensation](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-educational-background).

| Experience | Coding bootcamp | Bachelor's degree | Master's degree |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Under 4 years | ¥6.5 million | ¥6.5 million | ¥7.5 million |
| 4-7 years | ¥9.0 million | ¥8.5 million | ¥8.5 million |
| 8-11 years | Insufficient data | ¥13.5 million | ¥13.5 million |
| 12 or more years | Insufficient data | ¥12.5 million | ¥13.5 million |

A Master’s degree may lead to a bump in salary over having just a Bachelor’s degree, but when considering the opportunity cost of picking up a couple years more experience, it probably isn’t a worthwhile investment from a compensation perspective.

## Salary by Japanese Ability

We found that [low Japanese ability correlated with high compensation](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-japanese-ability). Respondents who had no Japanese ability had a median compensation that was 40% higher than those who spoke it fluently.

| Ability | Median Compensation |
| --- | --- |
| None | ¥10.5 million |
| Basic | ¥9.5 million |
| Conversational | ¥8.5 million |
| Fluent | ¥7.5 million |
| Native | ¥10.5 million |

At first, this is depressing to anyone learning Japanese. But I think something else is going on. There’s a lot fewer opportunities to get hired as a developer in Japan if you don’t have any Japanese abilities, and these opportunities tend to be setting the bar for technical excellence high. So while the pay for these positions does tend to be higher, it’s much more competitive to actually land one.

This means that while learning Japanese won’t necessarily lead to better paying opportunities, it will lead to more opportunities. We found that [respondents with higher Japanese ability also had less professional experience](/insights/2022-developer-survey#experience-by-japanese-ability), implying that you can start your career earlier in Japan if you pick up the language.

## Salary by Programming Language

We found that respondents who used Rust, Kotlin, or Scala had [the highest compensation](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-technologies), while those using PHP were paid the least.

| Language | Median Compensation |
| --- | --- |
| Bash/Shell | ¥10.5 million |
| C | ¥8.5 million |
| C# | ¥8.5 million |
| C++ | ¥8.5 million |
| Elixir | ¥7.5 million |
| Go | ¥11.5 million |
| HTML/CSS | ¥7.5 million |
| Java | ¥11.5 million |
| JavaScript | ¥8.5 million |
| Kotlin | ¥12.5 million |
| Node.js | ¥9.5 million |
| Objective-c | ¥7.0 million |
| PHP | ¥6.5 million |
| PowerShell | ¥8.0 million |
| Python | ¥9.5 million |
| Ruby | ¥9.5 million |
| Rust | ¥12.5 million |
| SQL | ¥9.0 million |
| Scala | ¥12.5 million |
| Swift | ¥10.5 million |
| TypeScript | ¥8.5 million |

### Comparison: Forkwell

In [Forkwell’s report](https://pr.forkwell.com/articles/annual-income-distribution-of-it-developers/), they broke down salary by programming language and age. They found that Go developers consistently made the most, and PHP developers made the least.

| Age | Go | Ruby | Python | Java | PHP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20 - 24 | ¥5.2 million | ¥4.7 million | ¥4.9 million | ¥4.8 million | ¥4.5 million |
| 25 - 29 | ¥5.8 million | ¥5.4 million | ¥5.3 million | ¥5.1 million | ¥5.0 million |
| 30 - 34 | ¥6.8 million | ¥6.1 million | ¥6.2 million | ¥5.7 million | ¥5.6 million |
| 35 - 39 | ¥7.2 million | ¥6.7 million | ¥6.8 million | ¥6.3 million | ¥6.2 million |
| 40 - 44 | ¥8.6 million | ¥7.4 million | ¥7.2 million | ¥7.0 million | ¥7.0 million |
| 45 - 49 | ¥8.6 million | ¥7.8 million | ¥8.0 million | ¥7.4 million | ¥7.1 million |

### Comparison: Qiita’s Engineer White Paper 2022

In Qiita’s [Engineer White Paper 2022](https://qiita.com/white_papers/2022), they found that 35% of Go developers and 40% of Rust developers make ¥8 million or more per year. Conversely, only about 12% of PHP developers do.

|  | Under ¥3M | ¥3M - ¥4.9M | ¥5M - ¥7.9M | ¥8M - ¥9.9M | ¥10M - ¥14.9M | ¥15M - ¥19.9M | ¥20M+ | No answer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JavaScript | 18% | 23% | 24% | 15% | 3% | 1% | 1% | 15% |
| Python | 16% | 19% | 23% | 21% | 4% | 1% | &lt;1% | 15% |

    <content type="html">Given the current climate in tech globally, people often ask me what the current situation in Japan is. Overall, my impression is that it is nowhere as bad as places like the US, but nevertheless I have been hearing stories of developers struggling to get jobs here. In this article, I’ll lay out my theories for why it is more challenging for international software developers to get jobs in Japan in 2023 than it was a couple years prior.

## Relaxing of COVID-19 related border restrictions

For much of the period between April 2020 and March 2022, border restrictions meant that it was nearly impossible for non-resident foreigners to enter the country. Japan publishes [data on visas issued](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/policies/statistics/toukei_ichiran_nyukan.html), and looking at the data on the most common one for software developers, [the Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa](/articles/japanese-engineering-visa-options), we can see just how drastically things changed.

| Year | # of issued visas |
| --- | --- |
| 2017 | 25,063 |
| 2018 | 34,182 |
| 2019 | 43,880 |
| 2020 | 19,705 |
| 2021 | 2,532 |

This meant the supply of international software engineers in Japan was incredibly constrained during this period, and so even people without professional experience, such as new coding bootcamp grads, had a relatively easy time finding a job.

While data for 2022 has yet to be published, as of this article, there are no longer any COVID-19 border restrictions. As new people have entered the market, both on new working visas, and hopefully job seekers on visas like working holiday or student, there’s simply more competition for jobs among international job seekers.

## US tech giants boom and bust

With COVID-19, the US tech giants expanded hiring incredibly. This extended to Japan, where the constrained supply of international developers coupled with demand helped [drive salaries to record levels](/articles/software-developer-salaries-in-japan).

Now that the wind has shifted, the US tech giants freeze and layoffs has sent ripples through the international job market in Japan. We found that in 2022, [only 63%](/insights/2022-developer-survey#employer-type) of English-speaking international software developers worked at Japanese companies. A not insignificant fraction of the remaining 37% worked for US tech companies. While Japan labor laws do make it hard to lay off someone, there are ways around them, including offering tempting severance packages, which has lead to a number of these developers leaving their jobs to look for new ones.

## Hiring slowdowns among major Japanese tech companies

As the US tech giants were going into a hiring frenzy, there was a pickup in hiring among the major Japanese tech companies, but not to nearly the same degree. Over the last six months, I have seen a number of prominent Japanese tech companies slowdown or freeze their hiring. On the other hand, small and medium sized Japanese tech companies seem to be hiring at the same rate as before. Through TokyoDev about the same number of people have been hired so far this year as over a similar period last year, and so it’s not like there’s been a catastrophic shift.

## Less fluidity in the job market

What has changed though is the job market has become less fluid. Without US tech giants tempting developers away from their jobs with astronomical salaries, international developers in Japan are more likely to stay in their existing jobs. As less people are job hopping, they aren’t leaving behind opportunities for new people to fill. This means companies can afford to be pickier with who they hire.

## Embracing remote work

Pre-COVID, I found that [only 33%](/insights/2020-developer-survey#remote-work) of international developers worked remotely at least one day per week. In my most recent survey, I [found 70%](/insights/2022-developer-survey#remote-work) of them could work completely remotely. While many “fully remote” Japanese companies want all their employees to live in Japan, not all of them have this requirement. As these internationally-minded Japanese companies turn to hiring remote developers globally, they decrease the demand for the international developers already based here.

## More people applying for jobs

Whatever the reasons, one thing I can say with certainty is that companies advertising their job opportunities on TokyoDev have seen a huge uptick in the number of applications they receive. Whereas a couple of years ago, a typical frontend developer position on the site got 40 applications in a month, more recently 200 applications is not atypical.

## Conclusion

While I think the overall job market for international developers in Japan isn’t terrible, and if you’re a talented and experienced developer, you should still be able to find something without much trouble, people at the beginning of their career have it tough.

[Junior developer jobs have never been a thing in Japan](/articles/entry-level-jobs-in-japan), but during the border closures, companies were forced to consider candidates who didn’t match their experience requirements. I don’t think that’s happening right now, and so I think it’s unlikely you’ll be able to get a job through an online job board like TokyoDev if you aren’t experienced.

So what should inexperienced international developers wanting to work in Japan do?

If you’re a fluent Japanese speaker, I’d target companies that aren’t specifically looking to hire international developers. My impression is that these are still hiring as before, and you’ll have more of a chance to stand out. [Wantedly](https://www.wantedly.com/) is one place to discover these opportunities.

If you want to get a job while living abroad, but aren’t a fluent Japanese speaker, I’d bide your time, work on gaining some experience in your own country, and pick up some basic Japanese skills. In a couple of years, hopefully the job market has picked up again internationally, and you’re in a better spot to get hired.

If you’re already living in Japan, I’d get involved in the developer community. In person events have started happening again, and [TokyoDev’s Discord](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV) has a listing of them. Look for ways to contribute to them. Give a presentation. Volunteer as staff. Be genuinely interested in the other attendees. It might take some time, but eventually it’ll lead to a job opportunity that isn’t advertised anywhere.

    <content type="html">So you’ve finally made it to Tokyo, and you’re looking for a place to work remotely in peace. Maybe you’re all set with a home office, but maybe you live in a one room studio apartment or you’re stuck in a tiny hotel room.

Whatever your reason, what are your options for places where you can work remotely?

## Co-working Spaces

A co-working space is probably most people’s first thought. They charge an hourly, daily, or monthly fee and provide free wifi, electrical outlets, and generally some level of amenities, such as free snacks or drinks. Some co-working spaces come with “phone booths” — semi-private or private enclosures where you can take calls and not disturb others. You can be guaranteed a fairly quiet area for you to work and not worry about being kicked out early.

While a quick search will bring up many options, those wanting search in Japanese might try looking for “コワーキングスペース”, and if you want to narrow it down further to places that don’t require a monthly fee you can add “ドロップイン”.

**My recommendation:** [AWS Startup Loft](https://aws-startup-lofts.com/apj/loft/tokyo) — the opening hours are limited to weekdays, but access is free if you register as a member

**Other options:** [.andwork shibuya](https://www.xandwork.com/en/shibuya/), [CASE Shinjuku](https://case-shinjuku.com/english)

## Cafes

Get a spot to work for hours for the price of a cup of coffee! Plenty of cafes have tables that come equipped with electrical outlets and wifi (for large chains, usually these details will be displayed at the entrance), and of course there’s delicious food and drink for a fee.

Depending where you go, it could work out cheaper than a co-working space, however it can get noisy and staff may ask you to order something or leave during busy hours.

**My recommendation:** [Cafe de Crie](https://c-united.co.jp/crie/) — A chain found all over Japan, the larger stores have plenty of seating, wifi, electrical outlets and affordably priced tasty food.

**Other options:** [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.co.jp/), [Doutor Coffee](https://www.doutor.co.jp/en/), [Komeda’s Coffee](https://www.komeda.co.jp/), [Tully’s Coffee](https://www.tullys.co.jp/), [Beck’s Coffee](https://foods.jr-cross.co.jp/becks/)

## Family Restaurants

Family restaurants typically offer affordable food and unlimited self-serve drinks (ドリンクバー), making them a popular option with students. Despite being “family” restaurants, most stores feature single-person counter or booth style seats to make it easier for you to visit on your own.

Electrical outlets are less common in these restaurants, and they can also be quite lively, so they’re better as a place to work for a couple of hours rather than somewhere to park the whole day.

**Popular options:** [Jonathan’s](https://www.skylark.co.jp/en/jonathan/), [Denny’s](https://www.dennys.jp/), [Gusto](https://www.skylark.co.jp/en/gusto/), [Coco’s](https://www.cocos-jpn.co.jp/)

## Net/Manga Cafes

Offering wifi, electrical outlets, and varying levels of privacy, net cafes have everything you need to start working. Service varies from store to store, but amenities can include drinks, food, manga, showers, private rooms, women-only areas, movies — with all these distractions you might have a hard time concentrating on work!

As a first timer, you’ll generally need to pay a one-time membership fee to join the cafe first. Net cafes can have a seedy reputation, so check out the reviews on the place before you enter.

**Popular options:** [Hailey’5 Cafe](https://www.hailey5cafe.com/), [Kaikatsu Club](https://www.kaikatsu.jp/)

## Public Libraries

Working at a library guarantees you peace and quiet. If you’re planning for a full day of flow time with no calls and no meetings, public libraries can provide you with wifi, electrical outlets and silence — and all for free!

Not all libraries offer study spaces or accommodate you bringing your laptop. This [Japanese website](http://www.tosyokan-navi.com/list_p_p/tokyo/all.html) can help you identify whether your nearby library suits your needs.

**My recommendation:** [Hibiya Library &amp; Museum](https://www.library.chiyoda.tokyo.jp/hibiya/) — A beautiful building that allows for self study, and has a cafe and restaurant where you could work if you feel hungry

## Karaoke Booths

Especially for off peak hours, like 9-5 weekdays, karaoke booths can be a seriously cost-effective option! You have access to electrical outlets, a private room all to yourself, you can order food and drinks delivered straight to you, and you can even sing a few songs if you feel like it. Thanks to the recent uptake of remote work, some karaoke chains even offer remote work packages, which you can find by searching for the chain name and “テレワーク”.

The downside is that your neighbour might decide to practice their screamo - karaoke isn’t the quietest place. But on the other hand, it’s an environment where you don’t need to worry about disturbing others when taking calls or talking in meetings!

**Popular options:** [Utahiroba](https://www.utahiro.com/utahiro_telework/tabid/139/Default.aspx), [Pasela](https://www.pasela.co.jp/oshigotopasela/), [Manekineko](https://www.karaokemanekineko.jp/campaign/mirrorpon/)

## Work Station Booths

You might have seen these at the station, or maybe in your co-working space. They look like a phone booth, but offer power, wifi, soundproofing, a seat, a desk, and privacy. Once you’re inside there’s very little to distract you, so you can really focus on your work.

With prices starting at 250 yen per 15 minutes, this is quite a pricey option but could work in a pinch.

## Super Sentos

A place you might not have thought of, but Japan’s “super sento”  can be a comfortable and relaxing place to get work done. Super sentos are typically multi-story buildings with services like indoor and outdoor baths, saunas, restaurants, massage chairs, and places to sit and relax. If you want a hot bath before starting your day's work, this could be the ideal option for you.

**My recommendation:** [RakuSpa Kanda](https://rakuspa.com/kanda/) — there’s a fixed fee for 10 hours and in that time you can take a good bath, enjoy a nice meal and make use of the co-working space.

    <content type="html">It felt like a fever dream when I got the job offer to move to Japan. *This was it*, I thought. *My chance to rebrand myself and seek better opportunities*.

I was twenty when I left my entire life behind in my hometown in the municipality of Kalibo to get a shot at working for an IT company in the capital city of Manila. Two years later, I found myself moving out of my home country in search of a better opportunity in a country whose language I barely even spoke.

This article aims to provide insight and help for foreign software developers, specifically Filipinos, looking for a job in Japan and is based on my own experience and that of five other Filipino software developers who uprooted their entire lives and moved to Japan.

## Why are there so many Filipinos in Japan?

[According to the Japan Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2021/01/24/issues/japans-filipino-community-puts-roots-moves-past-hostess-origins/), Filipinos are Japan's fourth largest foreign population after Chinese, South Korean, and Vietnamese communities.

Why is this so?

Aside from the spouses and children of Japanese nationals and the ever-increasing population of international students, many Filipinos have [come to Japan seeking work](https://web.archive.org/web/20070428232826/http://www.philippinestoday.net/September2001/reality901.htm).

In 1993, Japan established the Technical Intern Training Program. According to [JITCO](https://www.jitco.or.jp/en/regulation/), the project’s main objective is “to transfer skills, technologies, or knowledge (skills, etc.) accumulated in Japan to developing [countries] and other regions and to promote international cooperation by contributing to the development of human resources who can play roles in the economic development of those developing regions.” Included in the list is the Philippines, which has many skilled workers who just need the right job opportunity to flourish. It is also worth noting, however, that many foreign technical trainees have suffered under this program due to human rights violations, [prompting proposals for it to be abolished](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14882268).

Not only were there a lot of opportunities present in Japan due to the shortage of manpower in the country, but Filipinos also had a good impression of the Japanese, seeing them as well-disciplined, respectful of rules, and polite.

Aside from the fact that Japanese goods and shows were prevalent amongst the Filipino youth, Japan was also the Philippines’ top [Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) Source and Major Trade and Investment Partner.](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/country-report/2022/10/17/the-philippines-report-2022/japan-philippines-bright-dynamic-relationship/)

Likewise, Filipinos also seem to be leaving a good image for their Japanese employers. Just recently, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) said that around 80 Japanese employers were looking to [hire more Filipino workers](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2023/02/09/2243757/demand-filipino-workers-rise-dmw-eyes-ofw-japan-desk) because Filipinos were known for their [“excellent work ethic and friendly disposition”](https://www.rappler.com/nation/overseas-filipinos/susan-ople-says-japanese-employers-seek-more-skilled-filipino-workers/).

With [Japan still experiencing a worker shortage](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/30/business/economy-business/japan-worker-shortfall-study/) due to its aging population and declining birth rate even though there is a looming economic crisis, inflation, and a fluctuating yen, the country has made it easier for non-Japanese people to work in the country by providing a point-system to get a [“Highly-skilled Professional Visa”](/articles/japanese-engineering-visa-options) without having to spend more than a specific number of years as a resident of Japan.

For software developers specifically, those belonging to the [“Engineer”](/articles/japanese-engineering-visa-options) category are usually granted a “Working Visa” for one to five years. This in itself presented an opportunity for more Filipino software developers to come to Japan for work.

## But why Japan?

Why move all the way to a different country instead of staying on your own?

*“Mahalin ang sariling atin”* (*love your own*) be damned, making a living as a worker in the IT industry in the Philippines just wasn’t going to cut it. Dreams and hopes can only do so far to fuel someone when the odds are stacked against them.

To most of the software developers I interviewed, Japan has always been a dream country to visit because they were fans of anime, culture, and a lot of other things. But it was more of getting the job offer to work in Japan first which drove them to actually choose to work here instead of in other countries.

TokyoDev found that [the median annual salary of international software developers in Japan](/articles/software-developer-salaries-in-japan) was 9.5M JPY, while based on Glassdoor the average monthly salary for a software developer in the Philippines is around [98,600 PHP](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/philippines-software-developer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,11_IN204_KO12,30.htm), (roughly around 2M JPY/year). Despite the fact that the cost of living is lower in the Philippines, the quality of life between a third-world country and a first-world country is still worlds apart.

Better pay, better living conditions, and the opportunity to become a permanent resident in Japan rather than going back to the Philippines—those three were mostly cited as the benefits of coming to work here in Japan by the people I interviewed.

In a [2022 survey conducted by TokyoDev](/insights/2022-developer-survey#nationality) for international software engineers in Japan, it could be noted that 2% of the 558 respondents are Filipino. This is quite low considering the Filipino population in Japan. However, there might still be an improvement in numbers in the coming years seeing as [Japan has completely ended its current border control measures for overseas travelers](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/04/03/national/china-travelers-test-on-arrival-stop/).

## Life in Japan

### The application process

A common way to get a job opportunity as a direct hire software developer in Japan is through [job hunting sites](https://todorokis.medium.com/job-hunting-websites-to-get-an-it-job-in-japan-c7516846ce5). It’s easier to get an offer through recruitment agencies or employment agencies, but it’s important to check the background of the company that you’ll be working with.

“Do your research about the company. Make sure to check if they’re a black company or not.” Jonas advises. These so-called [“Black companies”](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/japanese-black-companies/) are notorious for having shady workplace practices and making employees render unpaid overtime that exceeds the 30-hour limit mandated by the Japanese national government.

It would be good to talk to previous employees of the company if you could get in touch with them through professional networking platforms like LinkedIn or other meetup opportunities. There are also websites like [Glassdoor](https://glassdoor.com/) or [OpenWork](https://www.vorkers.com) (Japanese) where you can check company reviews.

“Expand your network,” says one developer. “There are online boot camps and meetups available on Meetup, Discord, and other platforms out there where you can find like-minded people.”  She discusses how she was able to get help getting her resume reviewed and got lots of advice from Code Chrysalis, where she previously attended an online boot camp. She was also able to connect with one of the presenters, who ended up referring her to her new company. “Referrals are helpful to boost your application since the companies you’re applying for are probably going through several applications at a time.”

On a personal note, I was able to get in touch with and meet up with some foreign developers from [the TokyoDev community](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV), who gave me lots of insight into technologies and have been overall helpful with questions I had about living and working in Japan.

A tip that one developer shared was to “learn to negotiate your salary,” in relation to Japan having the maximum possible offer of a company being related to an applicant’s age and their previous work salary. He also wanted to emphasize how it was important to skill up while working through your applications and to not give up despite the barriers you encounter while applying.

### Preparing the documents

Preparing documents to go from the Philippines to Japan proved to be a difficult challenge for some of the developers. There’s so much lobbying and red tape around that, even for companies who already have a rapport with the government offices.

There are five government agencies in the Philippines that are mainly associated with the different processes throughout a Filipino worker’s employment overseas before they become a fully-recognized [Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW)](https://thepinoyofw.com/how-to-become-an-ofw/):

1. [Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA)](https://thepinoyofw.com/how-to-register-in-poea/), which is concerned with protecting the welfare and rights of all Filipino workers
2. [Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE)](https://thepinoyofw.com/dole-assistance-to-ofws/), which is an executive department of the Philippine Government, which aims to help “every Filipino worker to attain full, decent and productive employment”
3. [Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA)](https://thepinoyofw.com/maximize-owwa-membership/),*where the OFW has to register as a member in order to receive benefits like [health, burial, and scholarship benefits](https://thepinoyofw.com/owwa-membership-benefits/).
4. [Philippine Overseas Labor Office (POLO)](https://polotokyo.dole.gov.ph), which implements DOLE’s labor policies and programs overseas through its [several overseas branches](https://thepinoyofw.com/philippine-overseas-labor-offices-abroad/)
5. [Department of Migrant Workers (DMW)](https://www.dmw.gov.phhttps://www.dmw.gov.ph/about-dmw), which is a newer executive department effective under the Department of Migrant Workers Act (RA 11641) to help “facilitate the overseas employment and reintegration of Filipino workers, while taking into consideration the national development programs of the National Economic and Development Authority. All of the aforementioned agencies are technically under this department.

These agencies were initially created to protect OFWs (more specifically caregivers and housekeepers) from abusive bosses and to avoid illegal recruitment, but it has now been extended to cover more employment fields as more and more Filipinos look for jobs abroad.

To ensure the legalities of your employment, make sure to check the requirements of all these agencies with the [POLO Office in Tokyo](https://polotokyo.dole.gov.ph) and go through them with your company. “I’m so glad our HR [personnel] was kind and helpful with the process,” a developer says, knowing full well how tedious the process could take.

Thankfully, there’s a community of OFWs dedicated to helping out and guiding fellow Filipinos with the necessary processes. Two of the developers I talked to mentioned that they were able to get insights on how to proceed with processing their working visas thanks to a Facebook group comprised of OFWs.

### The rarity of overtime work

I’m happy to report that all of the Filipinos that I’ve interviewed responded that they had a good work-life balance. Despite being a country known as one of the “world’s most overworked nations” and for “Occupational sudden Mortality” they had a term coined for it—[Karoshi, or death by overwork](https://www.ft.com/content/982b1c46-d75b-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e)—everyone made it clear that they rarely work overtime.

“Our company has flextime so as long as I render the required hours per day, I’m good. But I’m kind of a workaholic…” one developer (who decided to remain anonymous for this article) sheepishly admitted. “But I do have time for my hobbies and spending time with my family.”

“I was actually surprised, to be honest.” Miguel—who has been working in Japan for more than four years now— says when he talked about how, despite working for a traditional Japanese company, he didn’t have to work overtime every single day as he had feared before coming to Japan.

### On fluency and learning the language

The developers I interviewed also had varying levels of Japanese fluency, but they all responded with the fluency level not being important to getting a job opportunity. Despite having a JLPT N1 certification, a developer says that he’s still not near native-level fluency since he still has a hard time communicating in a business context or with hospital staff.

Three developers mentioned that they had free Japanese lessons at their previous and/or current companies, but at the end of the day, reaching a better level of fluency all comes down to personal motivation and grit.

On the other hand, communication at work is one of the main concerns of a developer who had to work in a more traditional Japanese company as his colleagues only communicated with him in Japanese, with no English at all. “For the first two years of living here in Japan, I only focused on getting better at Japanese,” Miguel recalls.

Although it is common for traditional Japanese companies in Japan to require JLPT N2 or Business-level Japanese for foreign applicants, this is not the case for global companies. Of course, there would be an additional consideration for applicants who have JLPT N3 or daily conversational level Japanese or better, but it is not completely the deciding factor when getting the job.

Miguel also picks up on the importance of learning the language. ”It’s easier to market yourself if they know that you’re trainable. Especially since not a lot of Japanese developers could communicate in English.”

### The convenience

When asked what about living in Japan they liked, the number one most-mentioned thing was the “convenience”

Whether it be the [4 million vending machines](https://jw-webmagazine.com/vending-machines-in-japan/) installed all over Japan that sell different things from drinks to food and towels, the varied convenience stores (that 100% live up to their title), or the effective public transportation system, everybody loved the convenience of things in Japan.

Despite still mainly having a culture of making cash-only payments, there are also a ton of mobile payment systems being implemented around Japan like [Paypay](/companies/paypay), [Line Pay](https://pay.line.me/portal/jp/main), [Merpay](https://www.merpay.com/), [dPay](https://www.docomo.ne.jp/service/d_payment/), [Rakuten Pay](https://www.rakuten-wallet.co.jp), [au Pay](https://wallet.auone.jp), and the like.

For those who have already traveled or lived in Japan, you might already be familiar with IC Cards being used for transportation systems for those who don’t like buying tickets repeatedly. This would include [PASMO](https://www.pasmo.co.jp) (for those living in the Kanagawa Prefecture) and [SUICA](https://www.jreast.co.jp/mobilesuica/index.html/) (for those living in Tokyo). Aside from being able to integrate these services into your mobile phone instead of always carrying a card with you, you can also use these cards to pay for services.


### A culture of respect

How orderly the people are and how often they followed queues and were respectful of everyone were also additional points that were raised when talking about what the developers liked about living in Japan.

But of course, not every single Japanese person is like that, and there are still some cases of [unruly Japanese nationals](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/02/04/national/sushiro-sushi-terror-restaurants-japan/) reported around the country.

### Racism

It’s true that Japan has a low crime rate (which got even [lower as the pandemic began](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/02/04/national/crime-legal/crime-in-japan-lowest-level/)), especially compared to other countries’ statistics.

However, there were several cases of [police officers randomly stopping and questioning foreign-looking people](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14770633) whom they see walking the streets or riding their bikes and minding their own business. So far, I have personally known three Filipino software developers who were stopped on the street and interrogated, so I asked them for permission to share their experiences here.

Frae, a Filipino software developer who only came to Japan recently for a personal vacation got stopped by two Japanese policemen while he was taking a stroll around Shinjuku Nichome and taking photos. Initially, they only asked for his name and passport so he obliged, having heard about Japanese policemen doing this to catch illegal aliens.

However, he started to feel uncomfortable when they pried him for more questions and asked him to do a body search and check the contents of his bag. When he asked him what it was for, they explained (via a translator device) that someone had lost their debit/credit card. “That’s when I knew I was racially profiled. Of all the people they could’ve searched, they chose the brown guy.” he shares. After looking through all of his wallets to verify that the contents reflect the name on his passport, the policemen left, but the memory of the bad experience will always stay.

On the other hand, Sam—one of my previous Filipino coworkers—just brushed it off when he was interrogated by a police officer who thought that he stole the bike he was using. He was also asked about his name and personal identification, his address, company name, the number of foreigners in his building, and the length of his stay in Japan, among others.

“No bad experiences. Just good stories,” he repeated his mantra later on. Apparently, there were lots of reported incidents of stolen bikes around their area but he just laughed it off saying he might have looked suspicious that day.

Another Filipino developer who mentioned that he was also stopped and questioned by the police while biking around his neighborhood just shrugged it off, saying that it was bound to happen since he looked different from everyone.

There were also microaggressions—the side-eyeing, the judgmental looks, the moving away from the trains. I have personally experienced some of these, but I have gotten used to them over the years that I learned to just shrug them off.

“I think some of my coworkers were talking about me behind my back.” shares one developer. When asked if it was because he was a Filipino or just because he was a “Gaijin” (f*oreigner*), he responds with a shrug, “I think it was because I was a foreigner. Not specifically targeted to me being a Filipino.”

Of course, I’m wary sometimes. Despite the good impressions, there’s also bound to be some backlash about the bad impressions the Japanese have on Filipinos. But so far, none of the developers I’ve talked to have personally experienced any passive-aggressive or direct attacks on them just for being Filipino.

### Lack of diversity

Japan is still also lagging behind in numbers when it comes to diversity in the workforce. In the [2022 Basic Statistical Survey Report](https://www.jisa.or.jp/Portals/0/report/basic2022.pdf?230413) presented by JISA, only 23.2% of women work as IT Engineers, wherein only 7% of them are in managerial or higher positions.

Despite having lively bars all around Shinjuku Nichome, Japan is still notably [behind other G7 members](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20230508/p2a/00m/0op/013000c) when it comes to developing relevant laws aimed at helping sexual minorities in Japan. For example, same-sex marriage is still not recognized in Japan. They also do not have laws banning discrimination against sexual minorities.

A gay Filipino friend mentioned to me in passing how he doesn’t see himself living here in the long term because of such discrimination. And if he might want to get married in the future, there was no way of having that legally recognized here in Japan yet. I also have a few other Filipino friends who identify as sexual minorities but don’t really choose to discuss it with their Japanese friends due to fear of discrimination.

### Adjusting to the culture

Despite working in a Japanese company in the Philippines before getting a job offer to get deployed to a client in Japan, Miguel cites that there still had to be some adjustments to the workplace culture aside from having to speak purely Japanese. “They were always on time. You had to start and end meetings at a specific time. If the meeting was going to exceed the allotted time, you had to book the schedule for an extension of the meeting.” he adds. Although in most cases, more notably in Global companies in Japan, they’re a little more lenient with this

## Final Words

As Japan lifts [travel restrictions imposed due to COVID](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20230508/p2g/00m/0bu/026000c) and downgrades COVID-19 into a [Class 5 disease](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20230508/p2a/00m/0op/010000c), more and more foreign nationals seeking better opportunities are getting the chance to work in the country.

However, despite Japan’s seeking to get to a higher scale of globality, there are still a lot of barriers that foreign applicants need to overcome when coming here.

I myself had to go through more than 80 failed applications, around 20 recruiters, and 30 or so interviews. And after 4 months of waiting, I was able to get a new opportunity here in Japan.

And yet once you’ve arrived here, there’s still a need to prepare yourself mentally and emotionally. Having to live away from your family and the country you’ve known your entire life is no mean feat. Whatever your long-term plans may be, to some degree, you need to establish your roots in the country as well.

Even introverts might have a need to have a sense of community. “No man is an island” and all that pizzazz about having to interact with people for your well-being. I would say this is true—Filipinos are tribal people, after all. Maybe this is why I always seem to find Filipinos in almost every social gathering I go to in Japan. Now I have a network of Filipino friends whom I’ve met through random opportunities.

“You cannot make a community unless you make an effort,” one of the interviewees said.

    <content type="html">It’s been more than 3 years since I attended a dev conference - the last time was pre-pandemic, and it was a [conference I helped organise](https://www.dddmelbourne.com). I didn’t know what to expect heading into Matsumoto for [RubyKaigi 2023](https://rubykaigi.org/2023/) this weekend, but I was blown away by the quality of the conference and the warmth of the community. Some talks were at times hard to follow (especially considering I’m only 4 months into my Ruby journey), but the experience more than made up for it, and I’m so glad that I went.

## What is RubyKaigi

RubyKaigi is an international conference held annually in Japan, on the programming language Ruby. It aims to provide a platform for open source developers to talk about the cool things they are working on. RubyKaigi provides support for both Japanese and English speakers. It is held in a different city of Japan every year, and tries to introduce attendees to the charms of the area. This year it welcomed approximately 1200 people from all over the world to the city of Matsumoto.

## Talks

Over the three days there were 43 talks, 12 lightning talks, 3 keynotes, and 1 panel. I was really impressed by how much effort went into making the Japanese talks accessible for English speakers. All Japanese presentations had live English translations (which worked great), and English captions (which weren’t always great), and the ones I went to also had English slides.

The talks themselves were quite technical, but generally the speakers explained things in a manner that even I, with limited Ruby experience, could follow along. However, there were some talks that were super esoteric - at first I thought it was a me-not-being-technical-enough problem, but checking in with others after the conference it seems they didn’t fully understand it either. I learnt that this is a result of how RubyKaigi runs. Unlike many conferences where the focus leans heavily towards the presentation, RubyKaigi also focuses heavily on the presenters and giving them the chance to show off their passions/contributions to Ruby.

My personal favourite talk was ‘[Ruby vs Kickboxer](https://twitter.com/mishmashtan/status/1657265898087157760?s=20)’, which was about building a remote-controlled pool noodle sparring partner and was presented by a couple of Australians (from the same city as me!). It marks the first time I’ve seen the presenters act out a fist fight on stage. My next favourite was ‘[The Second Oldest Bug](https://rubykaigi.org/2023/presentations/jeremyevans0.html)’, which was an interesting look into the thoughts, processes, and decisions that go into fixing bugs in languages such as Ruby. I really enjoyed the way these presenters took the audience with them on their meandering journeys to find a solution.

Another highlight was the day 3 morning panel ‘Ruby Committers and The World’ - it was really interesting to listen to the thoughts and discussions of people involved with building the Ruby language. As a developer I’ve never really thought about how the language I write in came into being, or the decisions that go into making it the way it is - as long as it can do what I want it to, why think deeper - but there, right in front of me some very smart people were talking about exactly that. It was really fascinating to see them talk with each other about the things they wanted for the language and get a glimpse into how the process of a community developing a language might work.

## Community

On the final day of the conference I was introduced to the phrase ‘Matz is Nice and So We Are Nice’ (MINASWAN) - and I think this perfectly encapsulates my experience with the Ruby community this weekend. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. I was quite nervous arriving on day 1, as I’ve never actually attended a developer conference on my own before. But throughout the conference, people who I’d met somewhere else kept popping up to say hi and also introduce me to their friends. By day 3 I felt everywhere I looked there was someone I had chatted with and could wave to.

Twitter remains the social media of choice to connect on in Japan. Even post conference RubyKaigi still dominates my Twitter feed, with [#RubyFriends](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RubyFriends) and [RubyKaigi 誰も撮ってなさそうな写真](https://twitter.com/search?q=RubyKaigi%20誰も撮ってなさそうな写真) (RubyKaigi photo that no one else seems to have taken) posts. These tags make it really simple to feel a part of the community. I think it’s really amazing to have a community that is so willing to share their love for a conference days after said conference is finished.

## Sponsors

There were 29 sponsor booths set up, and by the end of day 1 I had received enough [swag to fill half a suitcase](https://twitter.com/mishmashtan/status/1656685672986742784?s=20). Among the swag, food was a popular choice, with one attendee tweeting a photo of curry roux, rice, and an apple (yes, there was a company handing out apples), with the caption ‘I now have all the ingredients to make curry’.

There was also an official stamp rally to encourage attendees to engage with all the booths, and when you got all the stamps you could choose from a selection of pins including one with Matz’s signature on it. While the stamps served as a quick draw to pull people to the booths, many sponsors also had their own competitions/activities set up. Perhaps the most novel of these was a sticker that can supposedly tell you how weak you are to alcohol (with the prize being a massive tote bag to help you carry all your swag). I really liked the creativity that went into breaking the ice and creating space for conversation. It was a fun and essential part of the conference.

## Matsumoto and RubyKaigi Impact

I arrived in Matsumoto on Day 0, via night bus. I used Day 0 to visit a number of tourist attractions - the highlights being Matsumoto Castle and the Yayoi Kusama exhibition at the Art Museum - and try local specialties - like soba, sanzoku-yaki and basashi. When I first arrived I saw a fountain that said ‘undrinkable’ and thought ‘of course you can’t drink that’ but I soon realised that in Matsumoto the norm is to be able to drink from the many fountains that adorn the town. It is such a clean and beautiful place.

Because of the conference there were Rubyists everywhere. On day 0, when I stopped to eat there were Rubyists in the restaurant with me. During the days of the conference we were given vouchers that could be spent at select businesses for food and it could be a challenge to find a spot free of Rubyists to eat! It’s a good thing lunch break was two hours. I think on day 2, in the Soba restaurant where I was eating lunch, the seats were completely full and aside from an old couple everyone was a Rubyist.

I loved how we were encouraged to explore the area, and thought the conference did a great job of introducing Matsumoto to everyone - especially to people who had come from outside of Japan.

## Afterparties

There were a number of official drinkups and afterparties, but these filled up before I had the chance to register. Luckily, I was not the only person in this boat and I found myself busy every day after the conference with people I’d been able to connect with. I ended up hanging out with the ladies from [emorihouse](https://emori.house), we ate a meal with the members of [WNB.rb](https://www.wnb-rb.dev), and a few of us went to Karaoke with some other international attendees and speakers. So even though I couldn’t join the official festivities, I managed to enjoy nice food, nice drinks and nice company everyday.

Japan really knows how to do afterparties. On day 3 I was determined to make the most of the last night and thought maybe the night would wind down around 2am. I was wrong. Starting the night as an Izakaya with some friends from [Rails Girls Nagasaki](/articles/rails-girls-nagasaki-first-recap) we chatted about the conference and IT in general. From there I went to the [RubyMusicMixin2023](https://conference.pixiv.co.jp/2023/rubymusicmixin) which involved a lot of bad dancing and yelling at people while the DJ played music loudly until 2am (it was awesome). Then I tagged along for [Ramen](https://twitter.com/nukumaro22/status/1657592463379558401?s=20) until 5am, which was followed by [grabbing a drink from the convenience store](https://twitter.com/bboobbaa/status/1657560214722461696?s=20) until 6. Finally I thought I’d go back to the hotel to grab my luggage, but ran into a [group of people](https://twitter.com/a_matsuda/status/1658129864866799616?s=20) by the river and stayed to chat. The group included chief organiser, Matsuda-san, and it was here I learnt more about the aims of RubyKaigi. Finally some of us went to get Coffee at 7am.

I feel like a lot of socialising at Japanese events takes place not at the conference but at the afterparties, so if you want to connect with people it’s good to plan accordingly (give yourself time to party and time to recover).

## Overall

I had a fantastic time at RubyKaigi, and hope to be there again in Okinawa in 2024. It was an event that really opened my eyes to the wonderful Ruby community and makes me want to learn more about Ruby, to try new things in Ruby, and where I can give back to Ruby. I’m very grateful to the organisers, the speakers, the sponsors, the helpers, and the attendees, because without them there is no conference, and also very grateful to TokyoDev for encouraging me to attend. Hopefully next year I can understand even the deeply technical talks!

    <title>Cover letters in the era of ChatGPT</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/cover-letters-in-the-era-of-chatgpt"/>

    <updated>2023-05-12T10:54:00+09:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Paul McMahon</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">At first glance, ChatGPT seems like it is a powerful tool for writing a custom cover letter for a job (when I saw cover letter, these days this often refers to the body of an email or the text someone puts into a “message” field of an application form). For instance, I was able to get it to produce the following for a fictional position that uses Ruby on Rails and React.

&gt; Dear [Recipient's Name],
&gt;
&gt; I am excited to apply for the Fullstack Engineer position at FooBar Software. With [X] years of experience in Ruby on Rails and React development, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team and deliver innovative software solutions.
&gt;
&gt; In my current role at [Current/Past Company], I have successfully designed, developed, and deployed complex web applications using Ruby on Rails and React. I possess strong skills in both frontend and backend development, as well as proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and database management systems.
&gt;
&gt; FooBar Software's commitment to innovation aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. I thrive in fast-paced environments, value effective communication, and embrace continuous learning. I am confident that my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and attention to detail will make me a valuable addition to your team.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience meet the requirements of the Fullstack Engineer position at FooBar Software. I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to the possibility of working with your talented team.
&gt;
&gt; Yours sincerely,
&gt; [Your Name]
&gt;

If you’re sending a lot of job applications, maybe the above looks good enough. I’ll admit, at first glance it looks like a plausible cover letter. When you look at the details, it’s not great, but maybe it is better than nothing?

Perhaps if no one else was using it, that’d be the case. But at least when it comes to software developer positions, I’m seeing many people using it. I’ve seen things like two applications in a row from different candidates who have almost identical cover letters, which left me scratching my head as to if they were different people, until I realized ChatGPT generates a very similar cover letter if I prompt it to based on the job description. I’ve seen people literally sign off their cover letter “Yours sincerely, [Your Name]”.

This has implications even if you aren’t using it. If your cover letter looks like it *could* have been written by ChatGPT, it’s much more likely that an employer will not bother reading it. So now is a good time to step up your cover letter game.

Some people will argue cover letters are a waste of time. It’s true that not all employers will look at them. But some will, and it will be the first thing they look at. A good cover letter will get them enthusiastic about you, which will get them in the mindset of looking for why you could be a match when reading your resume, instead of the default of looking for a reason to quickly reject you. ChatGPT will never be able to do this, as a good cover letter is both specific to the company and position, and personal.

So how do you write a good cover letter. Here’s my recommend approach.

- Keep it to two paragraphs. No one is going to read any more than that.
- In the first paragraph, demonstrate enthusiasm for the company or position. Do this in a unique, personal way.
- In the second paragraph, demonstrates what you can bring to the role. Again, something personal and specific is best. Rather than trying to cover everything, a single anecdote is better.

That’s it. This might be a bit abstract, but [this Stack Overflow article](https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/11/11/developer-cover-letter/) has a great example.

&gt; Hello Stack Overflow,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I’ve used Stack Overflow for as long as I’ve been a developer, and I recently came across a post about the architecture of your products on Nick Craver’s blog. It made me think, “I really want to work with these people who care so much about what they do.” I’m super excited to hear about all the tools you have built to make developer processes more streamlined; that’s right up my alley.
&gt;
&gt; At my current job I started out as a web dev, but I was constantly blocked by broken builds and the multi-step process for getting code out to production. I took it upon myself to fix this by prototyping a continuous integration system that eventually turned into the system our team still uses today. As we’ve started to grow, I’m focusing a lot more of my time on monitoring systems and currently evaluating some possible solutions.
&gt;
&gt; I look forward to hearing from you soon,
&gt;
&gt; Nick Larsen
&gt;

Clearly, there’s no way this is written by ChatGPT (at least as of 2023), right?

Another example is the one I wrote back in 2006 to get [my first job in Japan](/articles/finding-a-job-as-a-ruby-developer-in-japan).

&gt; Dear Sir or Madam,
&gt;
&gt; I am applying for the position of Junior Developer. In mid-August I am coming to Japan on the Working Holiday Visa, and while looking for potential jobs I came across ubit. Although I was not planning on applying to jobs until I arrived in Japan, I did not want to risk having the position close, as ubit appears to be my ideal company. ubit attracted me because it is a small company, with motivated and talented employees.
&gt;
&gt; I have just completed my BSc in Computer Science, and am going to Japan with the hope of finding related work. Although my Working Holiday Visa is good only for a year, I am interested in continuing working in Japan by obtaining a regular working visa. I want to work in Japan because it is a very different culture from Canada, but has similar standards of living.
&gt;
&gt; Last summer, I worked for [redacted], a company that develops web services such as message boards and web surveys. I improved and maintained the services using primarily php and mysql. The company took an anarchistic approach to software development, not using any software development methodology. Because of this, I felt though they made short term gains, their software quality and productivity suffered over the long term. Thus, I am excited to see that ubit emphasizes software development methodologies.
&gt;
&gt; これまで３ヶ月日本語を勉強してきました。 私の日本語はまだまだ不十分ですが、英語と日本語を話す人と仕事をして、これからも勉強したいです。
&gt;
&gt; Thank you, Paul McMahon
&gt;

It’s certainly not ideal. If I was to do it again, I’d make what attracted me to ubit more specific, cut the second paragraph, make it more concise generally, and avoid saying anything negative about a previous employer. But still, it was good enough, and obviously not a template.

A good cover letter can be the spark that leads to you getting a job. Don’t squander it by going with something generic.

    <content type="html">Last weekend I was at [Rails Girls Nagasaki 1st](https://railsgirls.com/nagasaki.html) - the first Rails Girls event in Nagasaki - as both an attendee and a speaker. It was a great experience where I was able to learn more about Rails, meet new people, make friends, practise Japanese and overall it was an awesome event.

## What is Rails Girls Nagasaki

Rails Girls is a non-profit organisation that aims to give women and girls the skills to understand technology and build their ideas. The Nagasaki event was a free workshop and by the end all attendees had successfully created a Ruby on Rails blog-esque site and deployed it to the web!

This was the first time the event has been held in Nagasaki, and just over half of the people there (including me) were actually not based in Nagasaki, but had travelled from other parts of Japan to attend. Out of the six coaches, only one was from Nagasaki - and both the sponsor speakers travelled from Tokyo. It just goes to show how much effort everyone put in to get the event off the ground and make it succeed. Also, with all these people travelling in - and Japan having so many edible souvenirs - there was a variety of delicious local snacks to try.

## Event Recap

The event itself was structured as a two-day workshop, with the first day set aside for Rails installation and dev environment configuration, and the second day for creating the website, lightning talks and afterparty. Coincidentally, there were six attendees and six coaches, so each attendee had a dedicated coach helping them the whole time. We worked through the [Rails Girls Guides](https://railsgirls.jp/) - which go from ‘what is a server’ to ‘now that you have deployed your website with source control, let’s add some tests’ - and answering any of their questions along the way. After completing the guidess, my coach also helped me design and implement extra features.

My Japanese isn’t fantastic, and my coach’s English was quite limited, but with the help of Google Translate and a sketchbook, we managed to make it work. While I have years of experience programming, Rails is new to me and tutorials/articles can’t answer questions like an experienced person can. I learnt a lot more about Rails conventions and random Japanese programming things from these conversations!

As [a sponsor of Rails Girls Japan](/articles/supporting-communities-women-technology), TokyoDev has the opportunity to speak at the events. So, halfway through the event I temporarily put on my speaker hat, to give a presentation (in Japanese) on the article I wrote previously on [female software developers working in Japan](/articles/working-as-a-female-software-developer-in-japan). Considering it’s been over a decade since I’ve done any Japanese presentations, I felt the talk itself went pretty well. However in hindsight I really wish I had tested the setup first, because starting your talk battling technical issues doesn’t help the stress levels.

The day wrapped up with an afterparty at the venue, giving a chance to mingle and chat with everyone over food and drinks. As I attend in-person events partially to meet new people and learn more about the Japanese dev scene, this was definitely an event highlight for me. It was really interesting to hear about people’s reasons for attending or what they hoped for from future events - we even started to talk about planning Rails Girls Fukuoka. Also, did you know Japanese afterparties sometimes have afterparties (that possibly have more afterparties)? It was a great conclusion to a wonderful event.

## Final Impressions

One of the things that stood out for me about the workshop was just how accessible it was for anyone to participate - the only things needed were a laptop and willingness to learn. There was a lady there who had never touched programming, but she was attending because her son - who works as a programmer - had told her about the event and encouraged her to go. She went from ‘I never understand when my son talks about work’ to ‘I think I sorta get it now’ and to me, that’s just so amazing.

I really enjoyed the event, and I hope I can participate again next time - not as an attendee but maybe as a coach! I’m really grateful to TokyoDev for the opportunity to attend (and speak!). I was able to see first hand how events like this can introduce women to technology, and that’s one of the ways we can reduce the gender gap in IT. Massive thanks to the organisers, the sponsors, the coaches and the attendees for making it all possible.

    <title>Will a company in Japan find out your previous salary?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/company-in-japan-previous-salary"/>

    <content type="html">When it comes to [salary negotiation in Japan](/articles/a-guide-to-salary-negotiations-in-japan-s-tech-industry), companies often have the upper hand. Not only do they know what they're willing to pay for a position, but it is very common for companies to ask you to disclose your current compensation, leading them to make an offer based off it. 

While you can always try refusing to disclose it, sometimes companies will literally not move forward with your application unless you do so. If you find yourself in this predicament, and are an in demand software developer, you can move on to another company (which is likely to be a better place to work). But not everyone is in such a fortunate position.

So what happens if you really do need to give a number? It might be tempting to embellish your current salary. But besides the ethical considerations of lying, you should keep in mind that companies will be able to roughly tell what your compensation  actually was (assuming you’ve been working in Japan).

The most likely way a company will find this out is through your withholding tax statement (源泉徴収票) from the previous company for the year-end tax adjustment declaration (年末調整). The year-end tax adjustment is [something employers are generally obligated to do](https://biz.moneyforward.com/payroll/basic/53837/#:~:text=年末調整を行うことは会社の義務である,-年末調整は&amp;text=故意に年末調整を,で定められています%E3%80%82) on the behalf of  employees. But it is possible to get around this by not giving the withholding tax statement to the company, and either asserting your previous employer didn’t give it to you in time, or that you need to file a return yourself because you did something like a side-job.

But even if you don’t share your withholding tax statement, there’s another way they can figure out what your salary is: your local income tax payment. In Japan, local tax payments start in June of every year, and are based on your income in the previous calendar year. If you’re a salaried employee, this tax is deducted from your salary, and paid by the employer. To facilitate this, your local government will send your employer two different notifications: one for your employer (特別徴収義務者用) and one for you (納税者用).

In the notification to your employer, it will show your name and the total amount of local tax you need to pay. Based on this, they can tell what your total income for the last year was. It’s impossible for them to confirm your exact salary, because you may have had certain deductions or extra income outside of your main job. But if you claimed to have a significantly different salary than you actually had, they could probably tell.

As an aside, this is also how people who are prohibited from doing side-jobs by their company, but do them anyways are often caught. However, [you can get around this aspect](https://letter.sorimachi.co.jp/taxnews/20220621_01) by selecting the option to pay the local tax on your extra income yourself. Because paying yourself is only an option for extra income and not salaried income though, this isn’t a way around having your future employer figure out your compensation.

If your employer is unethical, they have an even more devious way of finding out your compensation details. While the tax notification for individuals that is sent to the company is supposed to be passed on directly to the employee, [some local governments will send it unsealed](https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000434110.pdf)! If your government happened to be one of those, then your employer could theoretically look at it, and see your income divided into salary income and other income, making it even easier for them to determine what your previous salary was.

There is one wrinkle in all of this though. While a company may learn your taxable income, they won’t learn the exact nature of your compensation. For example, it will be impossible to tell if you got a raise midway through the year, or [what any bonus was going to be](https://tenshoku.mynavi.jp/knowhow/qa/5/090/) should you have continued working for the company the rest of the year.

Perhaps because of this, some companies will ask to see the previous years’ tax withholding statement before making a formal offer. There’s no legitimate reason they need this, and it is used solely to judge if you were lying about your compensation. While you’re under no obligation to share this, they could theoretically decline to make an offer if you were not to share this.

But if the company is not so paranoid, you may be able to get a job while exaggerating your current compensation. What will happen if you are found out after you're hired? While I’ve heard rumors it is grounds for termination, my research didn’t find any evidence that’s the case. [One article](https://www.shares.ai/lab/roumu/7571747) specifically said it would be difficult to terminate someone one those grounds alone, though it could result in disciplinary action from the company. If you went through a recruiting agency, that agency may also refuse to work with you again. And obviously, being seen as a liar isn’t good for your career prospects at that company.

In conclusion, while it is unlikely that a future employer will be able to find out exactly what you were paid before, they’ll have a rough idea of what you were paid. If you do claim to have higher compensation than you did, it will probably be challenging for them to prove you were lying beyond any doubt, but might have consequences for your career regardless.

    <title>Employer of Record (EOR) Services in Japan</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/employer-of-record"/>
    <id>https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/employer-of-record</id>
    <published>2023-03-08T10:33:00+09:00</published>
    <updated>2023-03-08T10:33:00+09:00</updated>

    <content type="html">EoR. Few employers seems to fully understand how it works, and even fewer working professionals have ever heard of it. So, what is this three-letter mystery acronym, and how can it help us swing the doors wide open on business building in Japan? Let’s have a look.

## What exactly is an employer of record (EoR) and what can it do for business?

An employer of record streamlines the hiring of employees in a country where the hiring firm has not established a legal entity. In other words, as Jeffrey Swartz, Country Manager for Japan at [G-P](https://www.globalization-partners.com/) puts it, “An EoR helps a business expand overseas by allowing the company to hire in a different country immediately, in a compliant manner, without the need to set up an overseas entity or subsidiary.”

Swartz works at one of four firms we spoke with to help shed light on this relatively new hiring tool. Each firm (Deel, G-P, Papaya Global, and Velocity Global) works in conjunction with businesses in need of cross border HR and payroll solutions, and all provide EoR services.

## How new is the idea of an EoR provider?

Expanding a business by using talent not domiciled within an employer’s home country is hardly new—even in a modern sense. Companies have been sending workers abroad for centuries, and outsourcing work to talent overseas for just as long.

What *is* relatively new, however, is how the EoR model allows for an employee/employer relationship that is more akin to *borderless insourcing*, than outsourcing. It’s an inventive model first established in 2012 when G-P Founder and Executive Chair, Nicole Sahin coalesced years of experience into a process that helped firms quickly and compliantly hire employees regardless of their physical location.

Prior to the advent of EoRs, professional employer organizations (PEOs) were the go to solution for hiring beyond one’s borders. Today, however, the use of [EoRs is fast supplanting the PEO for many firms given its inherent flexibility](https://remote.com/blog/eor-peo-differences), reduced cost and rapid ability to scale.

With the EoR model, employees perform work for one business while technically employed by another. This means the employee’s legal relationship falls within the domain of the EoR, whereas the management of work is handled as if the employee was right there in the home office. It's a situation not unlike the proverbial “man behind the curtain”; taxes, payroll and a host of other HR-related formalities are all taken care of by the EoR, but your “boss,” (or bosses) are those people you report to day in and day out.

## International Hiring at Mach Ten Speeds

The speed with which this sort of remote hiring can be accomplished is nothing short of stunning, and many operators in the space state they can clear through onboarding hurdles in hours, instead of the weeks and months typical when hiring for overseas assignments.

Despite the phenomenally nimble nature of EoR firms, and their ability to help with global expansion and employee mobility, the need for their services hasn’t been widely apparent until recently. The awareness of that need, however, is set to skyrocket. According to recent research, the global EoR market is [projected to reach $6602.64 million USD by 2028](https://www.marketresearch.com/QYResearch-Group-v3531/Global-Employer-Record-Services-Size-30796667/), up from $4299.12 million USD in 2021, a steady rise [firms in the EoR space are equally excited about as they band together](https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/global-employment-innovation-organization/remote-work-companies-are-set-to-change-the-way-workforces-are-built-as-they-usher-in-the-next-chapter-of-global-employment/) to capitalize on the burgeoning remote work environment.

## What’s driving the adoption of EoRs?

### Economics

With [a premium being placed on attracting and retaining tech talent](https://hbr.org/2022/10/survey-what-attracts-top-tech-talent) the world over, globally-aware, opportunistic firms are on the lookout for experienced tech talent they can bring into their talent ecosystem at different price points so more can get done with less. And one way to accomplish this is with the help of an EoR.

In Japan, where the government statistics portal puts the [mean at around ¥5.5 million](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00450091&amp;tstat=000001011429&amp;cycle=0&amp;tclass1=000001164106&amp;tclass2=000001164107&amp;tclass3=000001164111&amp;tclass4val=0) for software developers, opportunity abounds for recruitment-savvy firms looking to tap into a tech population here in Japan eager to see higher wages—higher wages that, for many employers outside Japan, would remain incredibly affordable. Even those in our own community who report their [salary coming in at a median of ¥9.5 million](/articles/software-developer-salaries-in-japan), devs here could be quite attractive to employers overseas.

[Median salary numbers for U.S. developers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm), for example, were around $120,730 in 2021, and $111,225 AUD (as of 2/27/2023) [for engineering talent in Australia according to Talent.com](https://au.talent.com/salary?job=software+developer).

Despite this opportunity for firms outside Japan to tap into Japan’s developer market, Swartz at G-P says the bulk of his effort is focusing on Japanese companies wanting to find overseas talent. “We have over 50 foreign companies coming into Japan to hire here but for outbound business from Japan, we are focusing on Japanese companies,” he says.

Clearly, even the weakened yen remains competitive when the talent pool is as wide as it can be when working with EoRs.

### The Search for Talent

Talent acquisition is another big reason firms in Japan are seeking out the services of EoRs.

"Certain talent shortages can drive Japanese firms to look to EoRs for help," says [Deel](https://deel.com)'s Country Leader for Japan, Takayuki Nakajima.

And G-P's Swartz says the use of EoRs in Japan, "echoes use cases in other countries," and that "many companies are looking to hire skilled staff outside of Japan due to the dearth of talent in the country."

Additionally, he says, "Some companies also want to create a follow-the-sun customer service model by hiring in several time zones.”

### Market Expansion

The desire to expand into one or more multiple markets is an additional reason, and Japanese firms seeking a flexible and efficient way to pull that off might appreciate the advantage of working with an EoR.

Again, G-P’s Swartz: "Once a firm has traction in a market, it may indeed decide to set up an entity, which will often be 12-18 months later. Some companies may wish to send one of their own staff on a longer-term assignment to launch their presence in a new market as well,” he says.

Deel’s Nakajima tells us that in the past, given the complexity of setting up a legal entity in a new market, some companies would simply ask friends at firms already doing business in a new destination country to bring in expansion employees under *that* firm’s HR umbrella.

Since the arrival of EoRs, however, this sort of loophole-diving is hardly necessary.

He says it’s common to see companies “use an EoR to bring in business development talent at the outset of opening an overseas operation,” and also shares an interesting flip side to this equation.

“Sometimes companies may wish to withdraw a legal entity in a particular country, but retain the employees working there. Or, an employee may wish to relocate outside of Japan, but remain working for their firm established in Japan.”

### Covid-19

Yet another reason we’re seeing a rise in the use of EoRs is rather obvious—the forced openness to remote work brought on during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Pre-pandemic, EoR services were predominantly used to enable global expansion for a certain set of companies, although we could already see a trend toward true global employment,” says Greg Brauner, chief revenue and marketing officer at [Velocity Global](https://velocityglobal.com/). But, Covid-19 has accelerated this trend, and we now see employers actively looking to deploy a globally distributed workforce.”

Actively looking, doesn’t necessarily mean actively willing, of course, and the upswing in experimentation with [a distributed workforce is hardly without its lumps](https://hbr.org/2023/01/research-where-managers-and-employees-disagree-about-remote-work). [Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296322008104) suggesting the potential of remote work, though, [has been piling up](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/whats-next-for-remote-work-an-analysis-of-2000-tasks-800-jobs-and-nine-countries), causing even staunch opponents to be more open to the idea.

G-P’s Swartz: “More companies are using EoR in their global and remote hiring strategies, and these days our target customers are mainly at SMEs across a myriad of industries. Generally speaking, we are selling our service to companies who wish to expand to new markets or access talent regardless of location.”

## What are EoR concerns for employers?

Concerns surrounding establishing an employer of record relationship, and working with talent outside one's own country borders may seem intimidating, but trusting in the process can yield quick and positive results.

Typical hesitations revolve around understanding local employment agreements, compliance, local labor laws, IP protection, and visa sponsorship assistance. But with all the HR specialists and legal teams EoR providers tend to have on the ground, there is little to be fearful of, says G-P’s Swartz. “We’re always on top of privacy and labor regulations all over the world.”

Casey Abel, Co-founder of Japan’s [HCCR](https://hccr.com/) and [ZooKeep](https://zookeep.com/), who has more than once hired outside Japan using EoR providers Deel and [Multiplier](https://www.usemultiplier.com/), had positive things to say about his experience working with EoRs.

“They allow you to tap into markets you couldn’t tap into before, and for the amount you might spend on salary for a single engineer in U.S. dollars, you can work with three engineers if you widen your hiring net just a bit more. Also, our costs for starting a firm used to be double given the relative salary differences in places like the U.S. and Japan, and then the costs for incorporation and the setup of a legal entity and administration would just add to that. Now, using an EoR allows us to unlock web devs anywhere.”

Abel brought up the idea of IP as well. “Some firms will need, and want to control IP as you certainly don't want your code-base going elsewhere.” He added that “having legal remedies is important” for when dicey situations might arise—something Amazon’s IT and legal teams were dealing with in recent weeks when it was discovered [employees were running code through Open AI’s ChatGPT](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-chatgpt-openai-warns-employees-not-share-confidential-information-microsoft-2023-1).

## What does all this cost?

Given the behind-the-scenes complexities of an EoR agreement, it is by nature a bespoke service, so what things cost tend to remain equally bespoke. As such, most EoR firms charge their clients monthly. A variety of additional fees might then be folded into this operational expense depending on what other services are required. Visa fees, in particular, vary from country to country and from person to person depending on circumstance.

“If the employee requires a work permit, we can assist with that as well and charge a one-time visa processing fee. Renewal fees can also be covered if needed at a later point due to local requirements,” say Velocity Global’s Brauner. “The total amount a company will pay us per month also includes the employee’s compensation, any allowances or supplemental benefits (if applicable) as well as the employer burden—as we handle all payroll items as well as benefits and more. Employers cover 100% of the cost and there is no cost-splitting with employees.”

At Deel, the fee for an EoR is $599 per month in any country according to Nakajima. “However the employer cost (which includes social security) depends on the country. Some countries are 5% but some countries are more than 30% against employee compensation,” he says. Deel also offers a [useful employee cost calculator](https://www.deel.com/employee-cost-calculator) in this regard to help with some initial planning.

Papaya Global [publishes their rates online](https://www.papayaglobal.com/pricing/).

## What are EoR concerns for employees?

Concerns from employees tend to center on the employee experience. Providers tell us employees want expert support in their own language, payroll that is accurate and timely, and an assurance that all their benefits (health insurance, pension, taxes, etc.) are taken care of.

“It’s as if the talent were working for a Japanese company," says G-P’s Swartz. "EoR providers can also arrange for expense reimbursements and confirmations of an annual salary, should a credit card company or potential landlord inquire regarding income.” Swartz adds: “And for non-Japanese, we offer visa sponsorship.”

Over at [Papaya Global](https://www.papayaglobal.com/), their Center of Excellence team says they generally see few concerns raised from workers on the EoR model. “What is important is that they understand the EoR Partner is the legal employer, whilst the hiring company is the day-to-day supervisor of tasks and performance.” This simple understanding, keeps things flowing in the right direction, just as if an employee were engaged in a typical remote relationship with an employer.

Velocity Global’s Brauner puts a final bow on this aspect of things: “Employees will be fully integrated with the company who engaged them and all topics related to their day-to-day work will be managed by that company. The EoR provider, on the other hand, is there to ensure that the work engagement is compliant in the local market and that all tax remittances and payroll are on time and accurate.”

### Equity

What about equity? The firms we spoke with had a different take on the temperature of this particular benefit, and given the complexity of providing equity to a distributed, international workforce, it’s not a surprise.

Regulatory frameworks vary, and a firm's patience in dealing with such offerings has as much to do with the personality of those at the hiring firm, as it does the desire to hire a particular candidate. Still, with increasing pressure to ferret out talent and keep talent onboard, there are indeed possibilities.
 
For Velocity's Brauner, an "increased demand from employers and employees—especially in fast-growing, competitive industries" seems to be afoot. And, to meet that apparent demand, in January of 2023, the firm unveiled a "global equity program" that has Velocity partnering with legal advisory firms "to offer compliant, locally tailored equity plans in countries across the globe."

According to Brauner, Velocity handles "the full lifecycle of equity issuance including assisting with withholding rates, payroll processing, supplemental reporting, plan registrations, etc."

G-P's Swartz on the other hand, says that because of how unwieldy offering equity can be to a distributed workforce, he sees a number of companies preferring to avoid it altogether. Alternatively, Swartz says he sees a two growing trends: one where companies try to avoid giving stock options to international employees altogether, instead "tying a cash bonus to the value of the company" or offering to "give cash compensation based on shadow stock schemes."

"We can’t put stock options in our platform," says Swartz. "But many customers choose to give options through a side agreement between them and the professional." Gains, if there are any, he says, "can be run through our payroll, and in general, are not taxed until the employee actually generates revenue from them—typically far into the future."

## What can go wrong in working with an EoR provider?

According to everyone we spoke with, what can go wrong is running afoul of compliance issues—and that comes from not working with an experienced and reputable firm.

A good way to ensure you *are* working with a reputable firm is to follow the activities of measurement organizations like [NelsonHall](https://research.nelson-hall.com/sourcing-expertise/hr-technology-services/global-eor/) and [Everest Group](https://www.everestgrp.com/peak-matrix/employer-of-record-eor-solutions.html). Both of which conduct regular research on EoR providers and provide rankings based on a wide variety of metrics.

Deel's Nakajima zeroed in on what’s known as [permanent establishment risk](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/COVID-and-taxes-Cross-border-assignments-put-companies-in-pickle)—a situation where a government could decide business dealings in a foreign country qualify as taxable because the business appears to be operating a permanent establishment in that country.

"This risk is dependent on the tax office in each country as well as the employee’s job description,” says Nakajima. “so clients need to consider the risk of PE (Permanent Establishment). There are a number of variables to consider when it comes to PE, so speaking with your accounting team, can help you plan in advance.

Outside of compliance, Velocity Global’s Brauner says there can be potential pitfalls when it comes to communication. “Poor communications strategy between the employer and the employee, and failing to integrate the employee properly into the corporate structure and culture” can cause issues.

“This is not unlike some of the challenges companies faced when they first embraced remote work and had to develop strategies to ensure employees felt engaged as isolation from headquarters or team members can result in low employee morale.”

To the Center of Excellence team at Papaya Global, communication is also a key element to a successful integration. “We have not come across many pitfalls. What is crucial is that workers ensure to keep Papaya, the EoR partner and the hiring company up to date on life cycle events so that correct actions are taken when need be.”

### How involved does the employee get in the EoR process?

If you’re wondering how much work there is to do on the employee end of things, you may be happy to know, that like the role of the hiring firm, your involvement in the hiring process is minimal, and in fact, your experience will likely feel similar to onboarding at any company with which you've worked before.

“Employees don’t need to do anything out of the ordinary with regard to taxes, etc. We take care of all the benefits and conduct the year-end tax adjustment on their behalf, as is standard here in Japan,” says G-P’s Swartz.

Velocity Global’s Brauner agrees. “The beauty of working with an EoR provider is that what usually could create a huge headache for an individual will be taken care of for them. Under an EoR relationship, talent is being hired as a legal employee of the EoR’s local entity, and the EoR provides immigration services and work-visa processing if needed, and all payroll taxes will be remitted to the local authorities as required.”

## Should talent be the driver of more EoR opportunities?

At this point, you may be wondering: given the lack of awareness of EoRs, should there be a championing of the idea from the talent side of the equation?

After all, [CFOs are still suggesting money should be spent on IT infrastructure and talent](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-02-15-gartner-cfo-survey-shows-sales-function-is-most-likely-to-see-budget-increases-in-2023) despite a questionable 2023-2024 market, and if firms don’t know how an EoR can help them gain access to that recommended line item, wouldn’t it make sense for tech talent in places where currencies are weak to proactively ring HR departments and ask, “Hey, we can work for less, and…, did you know there’s this thing called an EoR that makes it easy to hire me?”

Not exactly, says G-P’s Swartz. “EoR falls under the category of enterprise HR solutions, and it’s not so much for individual talent or job seekers. We do get approached by candidates themselves occasionally—the more in-demand their talent is, the greater chance the potential employer will engage with us to hire them through our model.”

Velocity Global’s Brauner says, “It depends. It could be as simple as a notification of employer change to the authorities, or as involved as the new employer having to apply for a new work visa entirely. An EoR who has in-depth knowledge and local expertise can advise on the best path forward, though.”

In general, providers we spoke with dampened any enthusiasm that employees stood a chance at leading the charge to increase the adoption of EoRs. Given that EoR providers work with businesses as opposed to individuals and that the entire process, for now at least, flows in that direction, the answer we got was that it’s possible, but difficult to plan for.

If our own research for this article could serve as any sort of guide, finding employers, attorneys, and HR leaders who were even familiar with EoRs stood as a bit of a challenge. For the individual candidate randomly calling into HR departments with a wish to work for a company and pitching the idea to an HR person or hiring manager not so much in the know, (in 2023, at least) you would likely be better off spending that effort elsewhere.

Deel’s Nakajima offered a little ray of hope, though: “Have them place a call to Deel, and a Deel sales rep may help resolve things by citing a few customer use cases.”

## Could networking help you work with an EoR?

So, while cold outreach might not be your best bet, *networking* your way into an appealing position could prove to be more fruitful—particularly if you are currently on a work visa and wish to onboard at a future date with another company open to the idea of using an EoR.

Recruiters work with EoR providers on all sides of the hiring spectrum, and G-P’s Swartz tells us: “knowing some recruiters that place candidates in your focus area, can’t hurt.” And that, “additionally, networking with organizations that assist overseas companies in your industry with market entry into Japan, might yield results, as well, because many companies partner with EoR firms and refer clients entering Japan to those firms.”

Papaya Global’s Center of Excellence team commented as to what that switch from being on a work visa in Japan to being employed via an EoR might look like: “It might be possible for a worker to leave their current employer in Japan and onboard with one of our EoR providers if they are a non-Japanese national. But how easy it is to onboard that worker with our EoR provider is going to be dependent upon what immigration/visa status they hold. In many cases, they are often able to transfer to our EoR provider without additional immigration assistance, but not always.”

So, there are options for the fortunate and the brave, but for the most part, the vast majority of these arrangements are going to be driven by the hiring firm. As with everything, though, being aware of the possibilities will place you ahead of most of the competition.

## What about moving to Japan to code?

For programmers working outside Japan, but at a firm with Japanese roots, or a firm simply open to the idea of doing what it takes to retain talent, fulfilling a dream to live and work in Japan might now be closer than ever.

“We do occasionally see companies using EoR as a talent retention strategy,” says G-P’s Swartz, “where an existing employee wants or needs to live in another country and their company uses us to compliantly employ that employee fairly long-term in that new country. It could be that they’ve been away from their family for 2-3 years due to the pandemic or perhaps they need to be close to older parents, etc. Occasionally, they may want to be a *digital nomad*.”

## How to negotiate an EoR with an employer considering hiring you

Velocity Global’s Brauner suggests “If you find yourself in a situation where you think the only thing standing between you and your potential employer [is an awareness of EoRs], it could be worth mentioning this option in a conversation.” In doing so, he says, you’ll want to “acknowledge and highlight the opportunity and key benefits for the employer,” perhaps mentioning how using an EoR allows a firm to hire the right talent for the job instead of one just physically near, and that using an employer of record can allow them to “employ talent wherever they might be or want to be.”

Clearly, putting your sales hat on here would be beneficial. And, if you can help hiring managers visualize a clear path to recruiting you, despite unfamiliar pathways, it could open doors for you much in the way it did for Scott Rothrock, a senior backend engineer living outside Tokyo hired by a U.S. firm in July of 2022. Before hopping on a call with the company, Rothrock went to work beefing up on how a company outside Japan might hire a software developer inside Japan, and landed on the idea of EoRs.

Fresh off this research, Rothrock was able to bring up the idea of working with an EoR as a way to hire him despite the fact that he lived in Japan. Reassuring the CTO of the ease involved in working with an EoR was instrumental in him getting the job.

Rothrock tells us how the relationship started: “I had a post on HackerNews stating I was open to work and got an email from a firm in America interested in my background. The CTO was proactive and positive, and the CEO was already aware of [remote.com](http://remote.com/), so the suggestion struck a chord. In the end, the monthly EoR support fee was minimal, and so they thought… why not do it?”

Comfort is the big key with all of this for employees and employers. “The realization that things are not as difficult as they seem was a big selling point for both me and the hiring company,” says Rothrock. “There’s something to be said for the psychological confidence you get in knowing an experienced firm is setting things up for you.”

## A foreboding future for business in Japan, or a tremendous boon?

In an article entitled, *Low IT pay stifles Japan's digital transformation*, Nikkei Asia reported a [10 to 1 job application ratio for IT professionals in Japan this year](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Datawatch/Low-IT-pay-stifles-Japan-s-digital-transformation). It's a statistic that hardly bodes well for industry powerhouses and startups in Japan hungry for IT talent and unable to find people who can help. But while Japan is certainly struggling to fill this need, it isn’t alone. Others in our backyard like [Singapore](https://www.huxley.com/en-jp/blog/2018/09/how-effectively-is-singapore-tackling-its-tech-talent-crunch/), [Hong Kong](https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/20/hongkong_tech_talent_trawl/) and [Vietnam](https://www.pwc.com/vn/en/publications/vietnam-publications/digital-readiness.html) are also having a difficult time—the problem is global, and EoRs appear to be a somewhat democratizing fix.

I asked Dieter Haberl of [EAW k.k.](https://sites.google.com/eawjp.com/eawjapan), who works with experienced professionals offering their services as fractional talent, if he sees experienced talent looking outside Japan these days to secure work not readily available or accessible in Japan.

“Yes, because the pandemic has taught us how to work-from-home. And, work-from-home effectively means work-from-anywhere. *Where* work gets done is now much more flexible and, equally, *when* work actually gets done has become almost as flexible, which then suggests that physical borders for work are now much less relevant. It’s of course a two-way street, if experienced Japanese can look at remotely working in other countries, the same is true in reverse. The only thing missing in the equation is an efficient marketplace for those types of positions.”

One must wonder though, as Haberl hints, that as an awareness of EoRs spreads throughout the international business community, and more firms take advantage of the model, how long might it be before a firm’s openness to pay higher wages swings in the opposite direction given greater access to a larger talent pool?

These hiring advantages may very well bring with them a bevy of complications for those interested in creating a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem *within* Japan, and the talent ecosystem to help support that effort. Being able to access talent from anywhere in the world is nice, but what happens when talent residing inside Japan remains here, but is attracted by employers *outside the country* for one reason or another. What becomes of business growth and innovation with Japan at that point?

The longer the yen remains disadvantaged against the U.S. and Australian dollar (to just name two strong currency states), the more important this question becomes, and the greater the risk to Japan’s ability to grow resident talent from within—regardless of nationality. Such a scenario may prove precarious for those employers inside Japan that remain unable to find ways to remain competitive when it comes to wages, nor open to welcoming (for whatever reason) non-Japanese talent into their workplaces.

Stress usually works to induce change. And, perhaps such a threat might act as a clarion call for government, education, and industry in Japan to work together to combat wage discrepancies, and the [historical lack of attention to encouraging work in the software industry](https://www.disruptingjapan.com/the-forgotten-mistake-that-killed-japans-software-industry/), so as to reduce the talent drain that is quite likely to result given the sort of conveniences EoR arrangements make possible.

Individual spending may remain in Japan due to increased wages that could come from overseas work, which could be good for the economy—but what about business building? It’s a question worth considering.

## Recruiting and Retention’s Best Kept Secret?

Probably not for long. Companies need talent—of all kinds. In exchange, people ask for challenging work, a total rewards compensation package that pays respect to that talent, mobility, agency, and a diverse and inclusive environment—even if it means there is no physical office. EoRs make the granting of this wish for employees easier than ever before, and for firms in need of talent and willing to expand their reach to areas they would have never before considered, that reach is almost endless.

“Indeed, EoR providers still seem to be one of the best kept secrets that can have a real impact globally,” says Velocity Global’s Brauner. And we are here to change that.

    <content type="html">For some people, [working as a software developer in Japan](/articles/first-job-programmer-japan) would be a dream come true. As an Australian software developer who has been in Japan for 6 months, I’m one of those dreamers.

If you’ve been looking to work in Japan for a while, I’m sure you’ve read other articles and heard rumours of what it’s like. The more common things to hear are that the hours are long, the pay is low, and the expectations of women are slightly outdated. According to TokyoDev's 2023 survey, only [10% of the respondents identified as women](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#gender) - and if we compare this to the [2021 JISA Basic Statistical Survey](https://www.jisa.or.jp/Portals/0/report/basic2021.pdf) the results aren’t much better, with women making up around 20% of IT Engineers.

But looking past the numbers and rumours, what is it actually like to work as a female software developer in Japan? To try and get a better picture, I spoke to a number of women at various points in their careers about how they got here, what their experience has been, what challenges they face, and where they see themselves going.

*[Disclaimer: This article only covers the feedback from the women I spoke with. Many other women have had different experiences in Japan that are completely valid. There are plenty of articles that focus on the negatives of working in Japan, and the women I was able to chat with were all quite positive about their experiences, so I’ve tried to focus on that area.]*

## Why choose to work in Japan

The response everyone who moved here gave me was they wanted to try living in Japan. Whether they wanted a new adventure, or there was something they had fallen in love with in the country, they wanted to experience life here – and work was just a part of that.

A factor for many was *the feeling of safety*. For many women, walking at night in Japan does not evoke the same sense of trepidation that it does in other places around the world. It helps that there are brightly lit 24 hour convenience stores on every other corner! Japan is a popular country to visit, and its fantastic public transport system makes it easy to travel around. It’s no wonder people are attracted to explore life here.

## What are the positives of working as a female software developer in Japan

All the women I interviewed had good things to say about their time working in Japan. Whether they were just starting out or had years of experience, their journeys have been positive and fulfilling experiences.

Those who held more senior positions related to me feeling as though people appreciated their expertise, and those just starting out recalled how their companies had given them plenty of support to find their feet. While acknowledging this isn’t the experience all women have had here, everyone told me they felt respected in the workplace, supported in their work and in growing their careers.

Everyone was also comfortable with their work-life balance. When asked about overtime, they said they didn’t feel pressure from their company to work extra hours, but they did sometimes pressure themselves into working overtime to get things done. The pandemic has accelerated the uptake of remote work. Many of the women I talked with were working from home, saving time on their commute and regaining time back into their lives.

Tech is a modern field and the treatment of women in tech is generally considered to be better than other industries in Japan. Japanese culture has traditionally had conservative definitions of professional behaviour for women, but foreigners are generally not held to those same standards. For those of us who are obviously not Japanese this can be an advantage, as Japanese culture can at times be difficult to navigate smoothly.

In a time when tech layoffs are at the forefront of our minds, Japanese companies can offer more stable employment. Those I spoke to who have worked for/with Japanese companies, told me there has traditionally been a strong sense of loyalty and family within the company and that mass layoffs like the ones seen recently in big tech would be very unusual. While legislation in Japan can make it difficult to fire people, foreign companies often follow the trends set by their parent organisations

## What challenges do women face as software developers in Japan

Software development is not the highest paying job in Japan, and TokyoDev’s survey indicated that women are often paid less than their male counterparts. However, the women I chatted with were generally satisfied with their compensation. They felt the amount they were earning was enough to enjoy a life in Japan, but were aware they could be earning much more in other countries such as the US.

The lack of women in technology did create pressure for some of the women I spoke with. It not only presented an external challenge - sometimes you have concerns you might want to share with another woman - but also internal challenges - imagine imposter syndrome but with the stress of being the only female developer ever hired by the company.

Moving to a new country means adapting to new systems. Most women I spoke with were still learning Japanese and used English as their main language of communication at work. Without Japanese skills it can be difficult to navigate other aspects of life, such as filing your taxes or applying for leave. Additionally, even if you are fluent in Japanese, there still may be challenges that come with adapting to a new culture.

There is a cultural expectation that women will not return to the workforce after having children. This can present itself in women not receiving the same opportunities, promotions, or salary raises as men. A few of the women I interviewed commented on how sometimes it feels there’s an attitude where women are treated more gently, as it’s felt they cannot work as hard as men, because they have more household responsibilities.

On the topic of children, Japan has great legislation in place for expecting parents, as the government wants to encourage people to have children. Both parents are able to take a year’s leave with pay (albeit reduced), there are child care subsidies until the end of junior high, and some companies even offer egg freezing. Japanese parents can be hesitant to take long-term child care leave though, usually due to company loyalty and guilt of leaving the team short handed.

## What does the future hold

Everyone I spoke with was optimistic about their own futures, and the future of women in tech in Japan.

Even though there is a large gender imbalance among software developers, there’s a rising awareness (not just in Japan, but globally) that as an industry we need to do more to bridge the gender gap. Many of the women I talked to agree that, while it may be slow, companies in Japan are taking actions to [increase gender diversity in tech](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/hiring-women-on-your-engineering-team).

The Japanese government is also pushing for more women in the workforce and more women in leadership positions, setting a goal of 30% of leadership roles to be held by women by 2030. The motivations here may be more about economics than about empowering women, but the end result is the same.

Now, when the industry is pushing to close the gender gap, is a great time for women who want to be recognized and receive the same opportunities as their male counterparts.

## Advice for other women wanting to get into the industry

The most common piece of advice from the women interviewed was to learn Japanese. While more experience does increase your chances of finding work where Japanese is not required, not being fluent can limit your options considerably. Having those communication skills, especially if you are just starting out in your tech career, will make you a more attractive applicant and open many doors.

When interviewing, take the time to interview the company as well. Not every company in Japan will be the right one for you. The women I talked with all felt very lucky to have found companies that work well for them. The interview is where you’re both putting your best foot forward, so if you feel uneasy during the interview process – perhaps you sense they’re looking down on you – it’s not a good sign.

Don’t be afraid to be the first woman joining the team either, there really is a pipeline issue in Japan - there’s a lack of women going into STEM and IT. The company could be great and just not have had the chance to hire a female developer before.

Finally, find your people, find a community for yourself - outside of your company. Moving to a new country can be daunting and it can be hard to connect with people outside of your job. It’s good to have a support network you can rely on. There are plenty of friendly, welcoming [tech groups in Japan with a focus on empowering women](/articles/supporting-communities-women-technology). See my guide to [tech meetups in Tokyo](/articles/tech-meetups-in-tokyo) to find people who share your interests.

## Closing Thoughts

Japan has a lot of potential and opportunities for women wanting to get into the software development industry. The companies that you’ve heard horror stories about do exist, but there are also companies here that will treat you with respect and help you grow your career. While attitudes are slower to change, the laws and legislation are quite progressive and Japan is investing to try and close the gender gap in tech.

Going into writing this article, I thought there would be more negative responses. I was pleasantly surprised that the women I talked to had such positive experiences and that they were so hopeful about the industry in Japan.

For women who read this and want to work in Japan - believe in yourself! Don’t be afraid to challenge yourself or make mistakes. You’re not expected to be perfect, just that you keep learning and growing.

Hope to see you in Japan!

    <content type="html">Every year, TokyoDev conducts a survey of international developers living in Japan. In the last survey's results, published in December 2022, I explored [the connection between gender and compensation](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-gender). The results were disappointing: women were compensated less than men. Even when comparing respondents of similar experience levels, this gap in compensation remained. What's more, [women had lower overall job satisfaction than men](/insights/2022-developer-survey#satisfaction-by-gender), seemingly driven by this lower compensation.

The gender pay gap has been studied extensively, and the reasons behind it are complex, but seeing it play out in data I collected left a bad taste in my mouth, so I looked for what I could do to help close this gap. The simplest thing was to support existing organizations that are already working to empower women in technology, and so that's where I decided to start, sponsoring the following organizations:

### Women Who Code

Women Who Code is a global non-profit organization and the world’s largest and most active community dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers. [Their Tokyo chapter](https://www.womenwhocode.com/tokyo) has many international members, holding regular events and also having an active Slack community. They've been a big supporter of TokyoDev's survey, and I think a significant number of female respondents came via them.

### Women In Technology Japan

[Women In Technology Japan](https://womenintech.jp) is the country's first-ever volunteer organization to focus on closing the gender gap in the tech industry as well as promoting diversity and inclusion. They hold events both in English and Japanese, including workshops and mentor dinners.

### Women In Science Japan

[Women In Science Japan](https://www.womeninsciencejapan.com) is dedicated to increasing the number of women scientists in Japan, as only 1 in 7 Japanese scientists are women, ranking the lowest in all OECD nations. They hold meetings in English, both over Zoom, and in person (including family friendly events).

### Rails Girls Japan

[Rails Girls Japan](https://railsgirls.jp) helps give tools and a community for women to understand technology and to build their ideas. One way they do this is through holding introductory workshops that teach women how to get started with Ruby on Rails. This organization started in Finland, but they've been having events in Japan since 2012.

### Waffle

[Waffle](https://waffle-waffle.org) seeks to close the gender gap by empowering and educating women in technology. They do this by organizing programming courses for women, primarily those in high school or university, and engaging in advocacy to close the gender gap.

## Our support doesn't end here

TokyoDev's sponsoring of these organizations is a tiny step in the long hard road of closing the gender gap in Japan. But I'm still excited to be doing something to move things in the right direction.

While we reached out to all the organizations that we could find related to empowering women in technology in Japan, I'm sure we missed some. If you're involved in such an organization and looking for sponsorship, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](/about).

Besides providing direct support for the community, we've also commissioned articles on topics like [hiring women on your engineering team](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/hiring-women-on-your-engineering-team) and [working as a female software developer in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/working-as-a-female-software-developer-in-japan).

## Additional organizations sponsored

Since we first made this announcement, we've continued to look for new organizations to sponsor.

### Women Developers Summit 2023

[Women Developers Summit](https://event.shoeisha.jp/devsumi/20231107) is an online conference featuring two tracks of presentations over a day. It is held in Japanese.

### DotsToCode

[DotsToCode](https://dotstocode.studio.site) is Japan's largest hackathon for women and non-binary people.</content>

    <content type="html">I've previously written about [how recruiting is a licensed industry in Japan](/articles/recruiting-in-japan), and because of this, [you need to be careful](/articles/legally-operating-a-job-board-in-japan) about how you operate your job board to ensure it isn't classified as recruiting.

In October 2022, [the regulations about job boards changed](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/11600000/000992910.pdf) (the details can be found [here](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/11600000/000994542.pdf)). I was actually blindsided by these new regulations, not hearing about them coming into effect until after they did (thanks [Fabien Brogard Cipriani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fbc01/) of [HirePlanner](https://home.hireplanner.com/)). Fortunately though, the definition of recruiting hasn't changed, and so I can continue to operate TokyoDev in fundamentally the same way as I did before. However, the new regulations do put some additional requirements on job board operators.

With the new regulations, businesses that provide "job information" (求人情報) or "job seeker information" (求職者情報) are classified as "Specified Recruitment Information Providers"  (特定募集情報等提供事業者). These businesses are further split into categories based on criteria like how the information is acquired (e.g. by crawling or directly), and in the case of job information, whether any information is collected from job seekers.

Most categories of information providers must register with the government before they start their business (existing providers had until December 31st, 2022 to register). Failing to register as an information provider comes with a fine of up to ¥300,000, and the possibility of up to 6 months imprisonment.

The only information providers that don't need to register are those that provide information about job information, but don't collect any information about job seekers. As even having a signup for an email newsletter about new job postings classifies it as a business that requires job postings, I suspect basically every job board is required to register. The only example given of a business that doesn't need to register is one that provides job information only in print media.

The registration process itself is free and reasonably straightforward. Once you complete the registration, you're issued a paper certificate that includes a notification receipt number, and are also listed in [a pdf](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/11600000/001176066.pdf) along with all the other businesses that have completed it.

The new regulations also specify a number of criteria for job information providers. This includes:

* Providing accurate and updated information about job posts and candidates.
* Not exaggerating your past achievements or customer's feedback.
* Handle candidate information according to certain rules about handling personal information. This includes only collecting the information necessary for providing your service, making it clear how you'll use the information, and not providing personal information without consent.
* Not receiving compensation from job seekers in exchange for providing job information, such as by charging a registration or usage fee to submit their jobs to an employer.
* Handling complaints from users including job seekers and employer companies correctly and promptly, making clear how they can get in touch with you (via email, contact format, or phone call).
* Providers are suggested to make public when the listed information was updated, how they handle the complaints from users, and the way job listings are ordered when searched.

If you don't comply with these regulations, the government may order you to do so, and submit a report of your improvements. Ignoring this or submitting a false report can result in a fine of ¥300,000. In cases the government suspects malicious intent, they may inspect your business on the spot, and be told to suspend the business. Failing to comply with a suspension order can result in a fine of up to ¥1,000,000 or up to one year in prison.

Ignoring the penalties, the regulations themselves are fairly sensible, and establishing them did result in me making some improvements to TokyoDev, such as including a date for when the job posting was last verified to be accurate, and instituting a new process to regularly check in with companies to ensure their listing is still active.

However, potentially imprisionment for failing to register your job board does seem like overkill. Knowing how Japan approaches this sort of thing, I doubt the government is going to send the police after someone who failed to register out of ignorance, and they're probably reserving it for someone trying to actively evade the regulations, but still, I question if it is actually necessary, and worry that it discourages innovation in this space.

    <title>The 2022 International Developers in Japan survey results are live!</title>

    <id>https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/announcing-2022-survey-results</id>
    <published>2022-12-08T13:00:00+09:00</published>

    <author>
      <name>Paul McMahon</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">In October 2022, I conducted a survey of international developers living in Japan. [The results are now live](/insights/2022-developer-survey), please check them out!

This year's survey had 42 questions, up from 24 questions for [2021's survey](/insights/2021-developer-survey). I was initially worried this increase may lead to a lower response rate, but I ended up with having 558 people responding, 28% more responses than last year.

## Salaries continued to rise

The [median salary](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary) of respondents was ¥9.5 million per year, up ¥1 million from last year. This may have been partially explained by respondents being [more experienced](/insights/2022-developer-survey#experience), with a median of 7 years professional software development experience, up one year from 2021’s survey.

## International subsidiaries pay extremely well

The [median compensation](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-employer-type) for respondents working at companies headquartered in Japan was ¥7.5 million, whereas it was ¥14.5 million for those at international subsidiaries.

This discrepancy in pay wasn't as pronounced at low experience levels: respondents with under 3 years of experience earned ¥5.5 million at Japanese companies, versus ¥7.5 at international subsidiaries. But for more experienced respondents it was extreme: respondents with 6-8 years of experience earned ¥7.5 million at Japanese companies, but ¥17.5 million at international subsidiaries.

Since the survey was conducted, we've seen hiring freezes and layoffs happening at many of the top paying international subsidiaries, so it will be interesting to see how this changes in next year's survey.

## Women paid worse and less satisfied then men

[Women were paid less then men](/insights/2022-developer-survey#salary-by-gender) across different experience levels. Their [overall satisfaction](/insights/2022-developer-survey#satisfaction-by-gender) with their job was also lower, driven by lower satisfaction with their compensation. There was no obvious reason I could find for this disparity in pay, which is quite disheartening to me. Adding questions that could help reveal what factors into it is something I want to explore more in future surveys.

If you are a women looking to improve your career, or are someone who is interested better understanding the challenges women face, [What Works for Women at Work: Four Patterns Working Women Need to Know](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17920210-what-works-for-women-at-work) is a book that I've heard can help.

## Remote work continued to be the norm

[Only 4% of respondents](/insights/2022-developer-survey#remote-work) were required to exclusively work from an office, whereas 70% of respondents could work exclusively remotely. 2021's survey asked this question in a different manner, and also found 4% of respondents never worked remotely, while 68% of respondents worked remotely on a daily basis.

Part of this could be explained by COVID not being "over" in Japan, with daily life here not being so different from 2021. But given the majority of people have been working remotely for over two years now, I see it as unlikely to change.

## React.js on it's way to become a defacto standard

When asked about what [web frameworks](/insights/2022-developer-survey#web-frameworks) respondents use on a regular basis, 57% answered React.js, up from 48% the year before. 18% of respondents used Vue.js, down from 26% the year before.

## Only 0.5% of respondents were unemployed

[0.5% of respondents were unemployed](/insights/2022-developer-survey#employment-status), down from 2% in 2021's survey.

## And much more…

There’s much more to be seen in [the full survey results](/insights/2022-developer-survey), so please take a look at them.

    <content type="html">In November 2021, I conducted a survey of international developers living in Japan. [The results are now live](/insights/2021-developer-survey), please check them out!

With 435 people responding, I had about 20% more responses than [2020's survey](/insights/2020-developer-survey). While in absolute terms this may not be a huge number, given the relatively niche audience I'm targetting, I'm happy with the results.

## International developer salaries are rising in Japan

For almost all of the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan's border has been closed to new residents. From my personal observations, this has made international developers already in Japan be in high demand. Among respondents of this year's survey, the median salary [was ¥8.5 million](/insights/2021-developer-survey#salary), up ¥1 million from the previous year's survey. While there could be other factors to explain this increase, it seemed to be fairly consistent across all levels of experience, so I think the increased competition for developers here could in part explain this finding.

## Remote work continues to be the norm

With [68% of respondents](/insights/2021-developer-survey#remote-work) working fully remotely, and an additional 20% working remotely at least 3 days per week, at least among international developers in Japan, remote work was very much the norm in 2021. Interestingly, respondents who worked fully remotely [were better paid](/insights/2021-developer-survey#salary-by-remote-work): they had a median salary of ¥9.5 million, compared to ¥6.5 million for those who went into the office at least one day a week.

## Back-end pays better than front-end or full-stack

Back-end developers had a median salary that was [¥1.5 million more](/insights/2021-developer-survey#salary-by-role) than front-end or full-stack roles. This was despite all roles having a similar average level of experience.

## Bootcamp grads earned similar salaries to CS grads

When looking at [salaries by experience and educational background](/insights/2021-developer-survey#salary-by-experience-and-education), there wasn't an appreciable difference in salary between coding bootcamp grads and those with a formal education, such as having obtained a computer science degree.

## Using English at your job pays better than using Japanese

Respondents who used English more often [were better paid](/insights/2021-developer-survey#salary-by-language-usage), with those using it frequently having a median salary of ¥8.5 million compared to a median salary of ¥6.0 million for those who said they never used it.

## Job satisfaction jumps at a salary of ¥8 million

Respondents with an annual salary under ¥8 million had [a median job satisfaction of 7 out of 10](/insights/2021-developer-survey#job-satisfaction-by-salary), compared to 8 out of 10 for those earning more than that.

## And much more...

    <content type="html">This article is also available [in English](/articles/why-i-sold-doorkeeper). 2010年にローンチし、2013年に法人化、2016年に黒字化した[Doorkeeper](https://www.doorkeeper.jp)を売却しよう、と決意したタイミングを、僕ははっきりと覚えています。それは、ある金曜日の朝、40℃の熱で保育園から帰宅した2歳の息子の面倒を見ていた時でした。 子供の熱や病気はよくあることですが、その朝のPagerDutyのアラートもまさに同様で、DoorkeeperのKubernetesマスターの一つが正常に動作しておらず、注意を払う必要がありました。種類が異なる二人の「わが子」が、同時に僕の関心を必要としていて、今思えば笑える話ですが、その時はいっぱいいっぱいに感じました。 なんとかその日を乗り切り、Doorkeeperの顧客への影響が出る前に問題を解決し、息子は翌週には保育園に行けるようになりました。でも、この件以来、二人目の（人間の）子供が生まれたら、もっと頻繁にこんなことが起こるんだ、と考えるようになりました。 自分で事業をすることで、僕はものすごい自由を手に入れました。他人の許可を得る必要もなく、熱を出した子供の面倒をみるために仕事を休むことができるという恩恵を大いに受けることができ、それを実現させてくれたすべてのDoorkeeperユーザーには心から感謝しています。 僕が手掛ける事業がDoorkeeperだけだったら、困難な時であろうときっと続けていて、収益を上げているビジネスから受けられる恩恵を手放すことはなかったと思います。が、僕には[TokyoDev](/)というもう一つの事業がありました。Doorkeeperと同じように、サイドプロジェクトとして、日本での生活に関する個人ブログとして、tokyodevはスタートしました。ところが、数年後には外国人開発者の日本企業就職を支援する求人サイトへと成長し、とてもうまくいっていました。tokyodevだけで経済的にやっていくに十分なほどに成長したことだけでなく、tokyodevのおかげで日本で初めて仕事を得た多くの開発者の人生に、リアルに影響を与えていることを目のあたりにできるという大きなやりがいも感じていました。 今の自分の人生のステージにおいて、Doorkeeperよりもtokyodevに注力するほうが理にかなっているように思いました。技術的にはできるだけシンプルに作っているので、サーバもなく、あるのはスタティック型のウェブサイトだけです。AWSのS3やCloudFrontがダウンしない限り故障するものもありません。顧客リストは比較的少なく、でも高い価値のある顧客が並んでいます。[ブートストラップビジネスの理想そのものだ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw)、と考えました。

Doorkeeperから退くことは、自分の人生をシンプルにする方法として魅力的に思えました。ただ、一体誰が買収を望み投資してくれて、運用するための技術的なノウハウを持っているだろうか？と考えた時、脳裏に浮かんだ人がいました。[Jonathan Siegel](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ジョナサン・シーゲル)です。

Jonathanに初めて会った時、あまり話すチャンスはなかったものの、とても思い出に残る出会いでした。それは、2013年に僕が運営を手伝った[東京Ruby会議10](http://tokyo10.rubykaigi.info/)で、Doorkeeperで開催されました。僕の記憶が正しければ、Jonathanは休暇で日本に来ていて、日本のRubyコミュニティの様子を見に来ていました。彼はRubyが好きで、彼自身の事業や、のちに買収する他のRubyistたちの事業でも、いつもRubyを使っていました。

Jonathanは東京に移住してからも、日本市場に特化した[電子契約サービス](https://corp.signtime.jp)を共同創立するなど、起業家としての活動を続けていて、僕が主催していた[Tokyo Rubyist Meetupのイベント](https://trbmeetup.doorkeeper.jp/events/85868)のスポンサーシップに関連してなど、何度か彼と会って話をする機会がありました。ある時、一緒に昼食をとっていたら、とても気楽な感じでDoorkeeperの買収を彼から申し入れられました。あまりに気楽な感じだったので、僕は冗談かなと思い、また、いずれにしても当時はDoorkeeperの売却を考えていなかったので、詳しい話には至りませんでした。

そのような経緯があったので、いざ売却を決心した時、Jonathanに最初に話をしようと思ったのはごく自然なことでした。彼にメールを送った2日後に、Zoomで話をし、正式なオファーをもらいました。その数日後には、お互いの意思を書面で交わし、1ヶ月後には売却が決定しました。

すべてがこの上なくスムーズに進みました。うまく物事が進まない自体や、お互いの意見の食い違いなどが起こる可能性も想定していましたが、そのようなことは一度も起こらず、最初から最後までJonathanのチームは合理的でした。

今回、JonathanがDoorkeeperの買収に投資した大きな理由は、日本の起業活動やテックシーンにもっと関わりを持ち、日本のコミュニティにもっと入り込みたいからだと言っていました。今回の彼と彼のチームとのやり取りから、それは心からの正直な気持ちだと僕は感じており、Doorkeeperは正しい人の手に渡ったと信じています。

今後は、John CrossがDoorkeeperの新しい代表になります。今回の売却における僕のコンタクトパーソンでしたが、彼もまた申し分のない人です。福岡在住の彼は、Doorkeeperの今後についてDoorkeeperユーザーと話をしたいと言っていました。何かあれば、&lt;john@doorkeeper.jp&gt;に連絡してください。

とても長い間、Doorkeeperは社会人としての私のアイデンティティの大部分となっていたので、寂しい気持ちになっているのでは？と思われるかもしれません。でも、実際はそんなことはなく、僕個人のために、そしてDoorkeeperの将来のためにも、間違いなく正しい判断をしたと感じています。Johnや彼のチームがDoorkeeperをどうしていくのかを見るのがとても楽しみですし、僕の元を旅立っていった「わが子」を遠くから見守っていきたいと思っています。

I can pinpoint the exact time when I decided to sell [Doorkeeper](https://www.doorkeeper.jp), the event management platform I helped launch in 2010, incorporated in 2013, and made profitable in 2016. It was a Friday morning, and I was looking after my two-year old who was home sick from daycare with a 40°C fever.

A sick toddler isn't an exceptional event. The PagerDuty alert that I received that morning thankfully was. One of Doorkeeper's Kubernetes masters was acting up, and needed my attention. Two of my very different kinds of children demanding my attention at once, it seems comical in retrospect, but at the time it was overwhelming.

I got through the day, resolved the issue before it impacted any of our customers, and my kid went back to daycare the next week. But it left me thinking that once my second (human) child was born this kind of thing was only going to get more common.

Running my own business has given me incredible freedom. That I could take time off from work to look after my sick toddler in the first place, without having to get approval from anyone else, is an incredible privilege, and I'm grateful to all the Doorkeeper customers who helped make it possible.

If Doorkeeper was my only business, it would be a no-brainer to continue on through the tough times, and reap the many benefits of owning a profitable product. But on top of all this, I have another business, [TokyoDev](/). Much like Doorkeeper, it started as a side project, just a personal blog about life in Japan. But over the years, it's morphed into a job board that's been very successful at helping international developers get jobs at Japanese companies. Not only has it grown to the point where it alone would be enough to support me financially, but it's also been incredibly rewarding to be able to see the very real effect it's had on people's lives, with many developers getting their first job in Japan because of it.

Of the two businesses, TokyoDev seemed the more sensible one to focus on given my current stage of life. I've designed it to be as technically simple as possible. No servers, just a static website. Nothing that can break unless AWS's S3 or CloudFront goes down, in which case I think I'm entitled to go down too. A relatively small customer list, but one where I can provide high value to each one. Pretty much [the ideal bootstrapped business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw).

An exit from Doorkeeper seemed an attractive way of simplifying my life. Who'd have the desire and capital to purchase it, and the technical knowhow to run it though? There was one name that I'd had in the back of my mind, Jonathan Siegel.

The first time I met Jonathan, we didn't get much of a chance to talk, but it was still pretty memorable. It was at an event I helped to organize in 2013, [Tokyo Ruby Kaigi 10](http://tokyo10.rubykaigi.info/en), which happened to be hosted on Doorkeeper. If I recall correctly, he was here on holiday, and decided to check out the local Ruby community. He'd always loved the language, using it to build his own business, and then later acquiring the businesses of other Rubyists.

When Jonathan moved to Tokyo, he continued [his entrepreneurial activities](https://xenon.io), including co-founding [an e-signature product](https://corp.signtime.com) focused on the Japanese market. I met with him a couple of times, including regarding sponsorship of [a Tokyo Rubyist Meetup event](https://trbmeetup.doorkeeper.jp/events/85868) I organized. During our lunch, he very casually offered to buy Doorkeeper from me. So casually I wasn't actually sure if he was serious. Nevertheless, I wasn't interested in selling the business at the time, so it didn't go any further.

Now that I had the motivation to sell though, going back to Jonathan seemed natural, so I sent him an email. Two days later, we had a Zoom call, which ended with an offer. A couple days later we had a signed letter of intent. A month later we had closed the deal.

Everything went as well as I could have hoped for. Part of me kept waiting for there to be some catch, and us getting into conflict with each other. But that never happened, and his side was reasonable throughout the whole process.

Jonathan has told me that a big part of why he invested in the acquisition of  Doorkeeper was to become more involved in the Japanese entrepreneurial and technical scene, and make further inroads into the Japanese community. Given my experience with him and his team so far, I believe that's an honest sentiment, and that Doorkeeper is in good hands.

Going forward, John Cross will be the new General Manager of Doorkeeper. He's been my main point of contact throughout this acquisition, and I have also had a great experience working with him. A Fukuoka resident, he's happy to talk with any of Doorkeeper's users about the future of the product. You can reach him at &lt;john@doorkeeper.jp&gt;.

After having Doorkeeper be such a part of my professional identity for so long now, you might think selling it would be bittersweet. It's not though, as I feel that it was unequivocally the right decision, both for me personally, and the future of the service. I'm excited to see what John and his team have in store for Doorkeeper, and look forward to watching my child from afar as it continues its life independent of me.

    <content type="html">As a Canadian, I noticed that we were relatively overrepresented her in Japan compared to our American neighbours. While the US's population is about nine times of ours, their population in Japan was only five times ours. This got me curious, and so I did some number crunching, dividing [the number of foreign residents](https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/nenkan/70nenkan/1431-02.html) in Japan by country by [the population](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL) of their country of origin, and then multiplying the result by one million to get something easily comparable.

Not surprisingly, Korea was the most represented in relative terms, in large part owing to [Japan's wartime legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans_in_Japan). Other asian countries ranked high, as did South American countries such as Peru and Brazil, which boast large ethnic Japanese populations.

The surprising outlier was New Zealand. With 3,672 residents of Japan but a relatively small population of 5 million, it boasts the proportionally highest number of residents among English speaking countries.

    <content type="html">I recently switched [Doorkeeper](https://www.doorkeeper.jp) from using [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) to [Active Storage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) for storing and processing uploaded files. The approach we took was a bit different from what I saw documented elsewhere, and this article explains why we took the approach we did, how we did, and things to watch out for when making the switch regardless of the approach you take.

## Background

Doorkeeper is an event management platform for communities focused on the Japanese market. I started it as a side project, but since then it has grown into a mature business.

### Using Paperclip since 2010

We’ve used Paperclip to handle user uploads since 2010. Paperclip was deprecated with the release of Active Storage, and though we explored moving to Active Storage at the time, as it didn’t seem to easily support CDNs, we decided to leave things as is.

As Paperclip isn’t compatible with Ruby 3.0, and Rails 6.1 brought an officially sanctioned way of using Active Storage with a CDN, I decided it was time to make the switch.

### 120k attachments to, 34 GB of files

At the time of the switch, we had 120k attachments stored with Paperclip, representing 34 GB of uploaded files. While this was enough that switch was a serious undertaking, I wasn’t concerned about things like minimizing the cost of file transfers, and so didn’t need a solution that would say leave the original uploads in place.

### 250 requests per minute, 60 uploads per day

As uploads are primarily performed by event organizers, and participants greatly outnumber organizers, we have very few uploads compared to our overall traffic. In a typical day we get around 60 uploads, while our Rails application is receiving about 250 requests per minute.

Because of this imbalance, having a CDN was quite important to us, both to ensure responsiveness to the visitors of an event page, and to avoid unnecessary load for our Rails application.

## Goals of our switching strategy

In making the switch, I wanted a strategy that would have zero downtime, be easy to rollback, and could be done in an incremental fashion.

### Zero downtime

While planned downtime can sometimes be the simplest approach, it also means you need to make a tradeoff between disrupting customers and disrupting your own sleep (assuming you and your customers live in the same time zone). Besides that, planned downtime offends my pride as a developer, and so if possible, I wanted to avoid it.

### Easy to rollback

To minimize the impact of something going wrong, I wanted an approach that would allow us to quickly switch back from Active Storage to Paperclip.

### Incremental

Attachments in Doorkeeper were spread across six models. I wanted to be able to incrementally migrate from models that appear in non-critical places and are few in number (e.g., for our listing of [companies in Japan that host tech meetups](https://www.doorkeeper.jp/会場)) to those that appear all over the place and are numerous (e.g., user avatars). This way, if we didn’t anticipate something correctly, and there was an issue with the migration, we’d likely catch it in a low impact place.

## Strategy for switching

With those goals in mind, I devised the following strategy for gracefully switching to Active Storage.

### 1. All new uploads go to both Paperclip and Active Storage

As a first step, we proactively stored all new uploads with both Paperclip and Active Storage. Because both Paperclip and Active Storage directly map the name of the attachment attribute in the model to what they store in the database, I created a module that would handle this:

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/pwim/b65a2c2fb0c6f7323a8991486c7c00d6.js?file=paperclip_to_active_storage.rb"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

By extending this module, and changing `has_attached_file` to `has_paperclip_attachment_with_active_storage`, uploads would be stored using both plugins, while only the Paperclip version would be used to actually serve the uploads (and so no other code needed to be changed).

### 2. Backfill past uploads from Paperclip to Active Storage

Rather than attempting to convert existing Paperclip attachments to Active Storage ones, I decided the simplest approach would be to just store an attachment in Paperclip based on the Active Storage one. This, when combine with the previous step, would mean we could have all attachments stored using both plugins, and thus seamlessly switch between which one we used to actually serve the attached file.

While there was a number of strategies I could of used to backfill the existing attachments, as it was a resource intensive task that could be parallelized, I decided creating an Active Job would be the best approach:

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/pwim/b65a2c2fb0c6f7323a8991486c7c00d6.js?file=paperclip_to_active_storage_job.rb"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Running a command like `PaperclipToActiveStorageJob.generate!(User, :avatar)` spawns the individual jobs that actually backfill the Active Storage attachments.

### 3. Use Active Storage to serve uploads

Once all the past uploads were backfilled for a given model, I switched it over to use Active Storage instead of Paperclip to serve the uploads.

As part of this step, I also removed the code for storing the attachment to Paperclip. This created the risk that if I needed to roll back, I could theoretically lose an upload. A more conservative approach would have been to continue to store the attachment to both, and drop storing it to Paperclip only after I was sure I wouldn’t need to roll back.

## Differences in image processing between Active Storage and Paperclip

Both Paperclip and Active Storage let you apply transformations to images, such as resizing them to fit within a specified set of dimensions. However, the way that they do this is different, and some of the subtle applications weren’t obvious to me until we deployed to production and encountered edge cases.

### Active Storage only transforms a subset of images

Paperclip attempts to process any attachment by invoking imagemagick with the appropriate arguments. Active Storage is more conservative, and if you call the `variant` method on an attachment with a content type that is not in `ActiveStorage.variable_content_types`, it raises an exception. Doorkeeper had saved a number of attachments that weren’t considered variable by Active Storage, notably `image/x-png` and `image/svg+xml`, and thus couldn’t be transformed.

To resolve the error, I inspected the files one at a time, which as there was only one hundred or so was feasible to do. Almost all of them were quite old (e.g. images for events that had been held seven years ago). For the ones that were still being actively used (e.g. a logo for a community), I manually transcoded it to an acceptable format. Otherwise, for ones that were no longer used (e.g. an image for an event that was held seven years ago by a community that no longer holds events), I just deleted the attachment.

Additionally, I changed the validation for the attachment to restrict it to ones with a content type of `Rails.application.config.active_storage.variable_content_types`, rather than something more permissive like `/\Aimage\/.*\Z/`. I initially had tried to use `Active Storage.variable_content_types` directly, however, in production I found that it was initialized only after my models were loaded, resulting in my validations not working.

### Active Storage treats PDFs differently than images

With Paperclip, styles you defined would be applied both to images and PDFs. Active Storage differentiates between variants (images) and previews (PDFs, videos). For one of Doorkeeper’s attachments we accepted both image and PDF uploads, and regardless of what the user uploads, we want to provide the same image preview. To do this, we defined a helper method that invoked either the preview or variant method, whichever was appropriate:

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/pwim/b65a2c2fb0c6f7323a8991486c7c00d6.js?file=attachment_helper.rb"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

## Regenerating transformations is resource intensive

In making the switch, the URLs to our attachments changed. As most of these attachments were in publicly accessible pages, it meant that as crawlers picked up the new image URLs, they would visit them, triggering the transformation of images. This peaked at us receiving approximately 400 transcoding requests per minute, which used a significant percentage of our computing resources.

Around this time, we were also noticing out of memory errors related to image processing. This is something we experienced very occasionally in the past with paperclip, but we saw it happening more frequently after the migration to Active Storage. It seems likely that this increase in errors was related to the migration, though it subsided within a couple of days, before we were able to make a concrete diagnosis.

    <title>Skyrocketing software developer salaries in Japan a portent of a seismic shift</title>

    <content type="html">Traditionally in Japan, salaried employees work for a single company their entire life, with their pay  rising as their seniority increases. So uniform is compensation that common wisdom even gives [a formula](https://news.nicovideo.jp/watch/nw1745758) for what your monthly salary should be: take your age and multiply it by ten thousand yen.  So at 22, a fresh university graduate could expect to earn ¥220,000 per month, with that rising to ¥300,000 per month by the time they hit 30. While there are some exceptions, historically, a salaried employee could expect to make roughly the same as their peers.

When I first came to Japan in 2006, software developers were largely compensated in this manner. Companies viewed programmers as paper pushers, and so rather than specifically recruit people with aptitude for it, they would assign a certain percentage of their fresh graduate hires to be developers, and give them a basic training course (something like *Learn COBOL in three months!*).

Around 2010, I started to see a shift in how developers were being compensated. While Zynga was raking in cash with Farmville in the US, the domestic equivalents like Gree and DeNA were doing an even better job of monetization. With all that cash, they were willing to pay above market rates for developers, and in 2011 they [announced starting salaries](https://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/6111164/) as high as ¥15 million per year.

Not only were these *social gaming* giants flush with cash, but the kind of companies developers worked for started to change. Historically, most software developers in Japan have worked for outsourcing companies, rather than building products in house. At least among developers in the Ruby community where I was most active though, there was a distinct shift around 2013. When I first joined the community most members worked for outsourcing companies, but by then the majority had shifted to working for product companies instead. Looking at [the sponsors of Japan's main Ruby conference](/articles/ruby-business-japan), you can see the shift: in 2009, only 5% of them were product companies, but by 2013, almost 60% were.

When you're building a product in house, it's much easier to see the difference that having talented and motivated developers make, and so these burgeoning product companies turned their eyes to the masses of undervalued talent. With better pay and working conditions than the traditional outsourcers, they were able to gobble up many of the prominent developers in the community.

These days, while [salaries for developers in Japan](/articles/software-developer-salaries-in-japan) still aren't at par with what you could make in the Valley, they've increased greatly since when I first arrived. In a survey I conducted in November 2020 of international developers in Japan, I found that [28% of respondents](/insights/2020-developer-survey#salary) reported making over ¥10 million a year (or over roughly $100k USD a year). To put this in perspective, [a 2018 report](https://www.nta.go.jp/publication/statistics/kokuzeicho/minkan2018/pdf/001.pdf) found that only 5% of salaried workers earned over ¥10 million a year.

There’s a lot to be said for this trend. While traditionally working as an engineer has been seen as a job with poor working conditions and low prestige, as companies have started to compete for talent, that’s changing. [A 2017 survey](https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/what-do-japanese-kids-want-to-be-when-they-grow-up-for-30-of-boys-youtubers-survey-says) found that among high school boys, becoming an IT engineer was the most popular answer to what job they want to do when they grow up. While the better compensation and conditions are certainly great for developers, recently I’ve started to think it’s also a harbinger of the end of part of what I love about Japan.

In societies there exists a continuum between individualism and collectivism. The US and Japan exist at opposite ends of this continuum. It’s no coincidence that the US, with its focus on the rights and worth of individuals, also sees the highest compensation for them, while in collectivist Japan, where group harmony takes center stage to individual needs, people have been compensated more evenly.

While there are certainly issues with Japan’s collectivist culture, being in a society where people default to thinking about the group over themselves has profound benefits. It’s why Japan has little crime, why encounters with rude strangers are almost non-existent, and dare I say even why Japan has done so well in the face of COVID-19.

Companies shifting to paying the most productive individuals significantly more than others erodes the collectivism that creates much of what is exceptional about Japan. While the forces of capitalism may make this shift inevitable, it gives me pause from cheerleading Japan’s skyrocketing developer salaries while [income inequality rises](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/03/japans-middle-class-is-disappearing-as-poverty-rises-warns-economist.html).

There’s been many attempts to build the Silicon Valley of Japan, with a focus on the prosperity a tech hub could provide. But wealth isn’t the only thing the Valley is famous for, [its struggles with poverty](https://computerhistory.org/blog/homelessness-the-problem-that-even-silicon-valley-cant-seem-to-solve/) are also legendary. If Japan can find a way to synthesize the innovation a results-oriented culture brings while keeping its focus on the needs of the group, it would truly be a great outcome. I worry though that in its quest for greater wealth, Japan will be forced to sacrifice the benefits of a collectivist society, losing what has made it so attractive to me.

    <title>The 2020 International Developers in Japan results are live!</title>

    <content type="html">In November 2020, I conducted a survey of international developers living in Japan to better paint a picture of what the typical foreign developer life is like. [The results are now live](/insights/2020-developer-survey), please check them out!

With 362 people responding, I had about 50% more responses than [2019's survey](/articles/japan-developer-salaries). While in absolute terms, that isn't a very large turnout, given the very niche audience I'm targetting, it's quite a respectable sample.

## A team effort

Given that so many people took their time to help me out with this, I wanted to repay their efforts by coming out with something more than just a simple summary of them like I'd done in previous years. On my own, I realized I could only do so much, so I enlisted the help of others in it.

[Tom Coombs](https://www.manwomanandchild.com/), who I originally knew from his role as the organizer of one of my favourite events, [UX Talk Tokyo](http://www.uxtalktokyo.com/), helped with the data analysis and visualization. He's also written an article about his experience [building the charts with d3](https://medium.com/@tomcoombs/using-d3-to-present-survey-results-a231733d3ddb).

[Mathieu Mayer](https://mathieumayer.com/), who had previously helped me with TokyoDev's redesign, helped with giving the results a visual polish.

[Many others](/insights/2020-developer-survey#team) helped with previewing the results before they went live.

## A little outreach goes a long way

This year's survey asked about gender. Forty minutes after launching the survey to my audience, I had 41 responses, but only two from women. Not only was that a bad turnout percentage-wise, in absolute terms it was looking so miniscule that I wasn't going to be able to make any meaningful correlations with gender.

I turned to [Tutti Quintella](https://tuttiq.me/), a group manager at Mercari and director of [Women Who Code Tokyo](https://www.womenwhocode.com/) about how to better reach a diverse audience. She suggested I explicitly put out the call to women to answer and that I reach out to women-heavy communities, and also offered to share it through Women Who Code Tokyo.

With just putting in a little more effort, I ended up with [12% of respondents](/insights/2020-developer-survey#gender) indicating they were women or non-binary, more than two times what I had got before I did any explicit outreach.

## Start planning earlier

2020 was an exceptional year, and I think we all had a lot on our minds. It wasn't until late October I realized that if I was going to conduct another survey this year, I had to get moving. This ended up rushing things a bit more than I would have liked, and didn't give me as much of a chance to do community outreach before I actually launched it.

## The next survey will launch January 2022

One of the challenges with doing a survey like this is that the value of the responses degrade over time, so there's a tension between quickly putting something out, versus spending the time it takes to get something polished.

Conducting the survey in November meant that I was still working on the results over the New Year's break, a time when it seems like it should be able to get some work done, but you never make as much progress as you anticipate. So for the next survey, rather than launching it at the end of this year, I'll do it at the beginning of next year instead.

    <title>Running a job board in Japan can land you in prison</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/legally-operating-a-job-board-in-japan"/>
    <id>https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/legally-operating-a-job-board-in-japan</id>
    <published>2020-11-27T11:33:00+09:00</published>

    <content type="html">*Note, [new regulations were introduced in October 2022 regarding job boards](/articles/keeping-job-board-legal-in-japan). While the principles for determining whether or not something is considered recruiting with regards to licensing is unchanged, there are additional requirements placed on job boards.*

I started [TokyoDev](/) as a side project, and when I first launched it, it never occurred to me that there might be legal repercussions for advertising job postings. However, in Japan, [recruiting is a licensed industry](/articles/recruiting-in-japan), with criminal penalties of up to a year in prison for practicing without a license, and depending on how a job board is run, it may be classified as recruiting.

Initially my clients were small startups, who weren't even aware of the licensing requirement. However, eventually a prospective client at a larger company was blocked by their legal team because I didn't have a license. This triggered me to investigate the implications of operating a job board in Japan with regards to recruitment licensing.

Fortunately, the employment security bureau has released guidelines that explicitly address the difference between providing a job board and recruitment (note, these guidelines appear to have been removed with the new regulations regarding job boards). They aren't the easiest thing to read, even if you're a native Japanese speaker. I've included a rough [English translation](#english) at the end of this article.

The gist of it is, because all the job opportunities on TokyoDev are public, I don't solicit specific individuals to apply for jobs, and applications go directly to the companies without me doing any screening, I'm complying with the guidelines and thus don't need a license. Just to be safe, I was able to confirm directly with the employment security bureau that my interpretation is correct, and I'm operating TokyoDev in a manner congruent with the guidelines. Furthermore, I was able to get some clarifications from them about some of the finer points.

With TokyoDev, I sometimes provide companies with an email address on my domain where candidates can send an application. Applications in turn get forwarded to the company. I confirmed that's allowed, so long as I don't change the contents of the emails or screen the applications. I am allowed to filter out any spam though.

I also confirmed that the method of compensation is independent of whether or not I need a license. Whether I was to charge companies a flat fee to post a job, a fee upon successful hire like traditional recruiters do, or even if I was to post jobs for free, it wouldn't make a difference with regards to licensing requirements.

I still sometimes have companies asking me if I have a license, but since I've been able to point them to the guidelines, I've been able to move forward with them despite not having one.

&lt;em id="english"&gt;Translation of the Japanese guidelines follows. [As of October 2022, the web page we translated no longer exists. However, [Business Operation Procedures for Providing Recruitment Information](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/11600000/000994542.pdf) contains similar guidelines.]  This translation was done by someone who's not an expert in the area, and so shouldn't be relied upon for more than getting an overview of the guidelines.&lt;/em&gt;

## Guidelines to distinguish between providing information of job seekers and job offers, and employment placement on the internet by a private company

Guidelines to judge whether or not an online job site run by a private company is deemed to be an “employment placement” prescribed by Article 4-1 of Employment Security Law are determined as follows. If a person is going to do a business defined as “employment placement” by these guidelines, he/she needs to be approved by Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare. Each item has a specific example.

### Background

1\. Article 4-1 of Employment Security Law defines “employment placement” as “to accept job posting and job application and to encourage employment agreement between recruiters and job seekers. Therefore, an online site which only provides information of recruiters and job seekers, and does not accept job applications nor encourage employment agreements is called “information provider” and is not deemed to be “employment placement” with need to be legitimately approved.

2\. However, recently, providing information of recruiters and job seekers on the internet has been increasing, and some of them have been changing their roles from just being “information providers” to something more than just enabling to browse information of recruiters and job seekers. This includes enabling mutual communications between recruiters and job seekers as well as establishing a way to automatically send information that matches recruiters’ requirements and/or job seekers’ qualifications. Of course, not all of them are deemed to be an “employment placement”, but there are some cases that are difficult to determine whether or not it should be deemed to be an “employment placement”. This is why these guidelines were created.

### Guidelines to determine if an online job site run by a private company is just an information provider, or employment placement

I. These guidelines are to make clear the difference of “recruiters and job seekers’ information provider” and “employment placement” on the internet in order to secure adequate operation of the law.

II. In these guidelines, “providing recruiters and job seekers’ information on the internet” means that an information provider allows recruiters and job seekers to view job information (both includes information that enables people to identify individual recruiter or job seeker such as company’s name and address, job seeker’s name and address, which will be called just “information” hereafter) on its homepage.
Besides, it includes providing additional services for job seekers or recruiters, such as providing a convenient way to create and send emails for job application or recruitment.

III. If an online recruiters’ and job seekers’ information provider matches either of following 1 to 3, it is deemed to be an employment placement.

1. Without objective and explicit search criteria set in advance, information provider chooses and changes the contents of information or who it is providing.
2. Information provider informs job seekers of job information, or inform recruiters of job seekers’ information. (Example 2)
3. When communications between job seekers and recruiters are relayed via information provider’s homepage, it changes the contents for the communication. (Example 3)

IV. Besides III, based on the contents of information provider’s advertisement, and/or the contents of contracts between information provider and job seekers or recruiters, if information provider is introducing job seekers to recruiters or recruiters to job seekers, and providing information of job seekers and recruiters on the internet is conducted as a part of it, it is overall deemed to be an employment placement. (Example 4)

#### Example 2: Information provider itself encourages job applications or hiring

Although when information provider proactively contacts job seekers or recruiters to encourage applying or hiring, adjusts schedule for job interviews, or provides additional information, and it is considered just to assist recruitment successes, it is deemed to be an employment placement.

However, even when all of these are conducted online, it is considered that information provider and job seekers or recruiters only use emails as a substitute communication tool for job interview, telephone, fax or mails. Therefore, it does not influence on judging whether or not it is deemed to be an employment placement.

#### Example 3: Job seekers or recruiters to apply for a job or recruit people by emails via homepage of information provider, but still information provider is not deemed to be an employment placement

If information provider is only providing necessary email addresses without changing the contents of communications when information provider allows job seekers or recruiters to send emails to recruiters or job seekers via its homepage in order to apply for a job or recruit people directly online, it is not deemed to be an employment placement.
Also, regarding the emails, when information provider has a specific form to allow job seekers or recruiters to fill in necessary information and create emails, it is not deemed to be an employment placement.

#### Example 4: Advertisement targeting job seekers and job recruiters as an employment placement

If information provider recruits job seekers or recruiters by saying something like “we will find a job you are looking for” or “we will introduce candidates who will fit your company”, and provides potential recruiters or job seekers information such as names and phone numbers to job seekers or recruiters on the internet, it is deemed to be an employment placement as a whole.

    <content type="html">I've launched the 2020 International Developers in Japan Survey. With this survey, I intend to paint a picture of what life is like for international developers here, both to help people considering making the move here, and also for those already living here to better understand the experience of their peers.

[Last year's survey](/articles/japan-developer-salaries) got 219 responses, and this year I intend to reach an even wider audience. If you're working as a developer in Japan, I'd love you to take the survey. It should take less than five minutes to complete, and it is completely anonymous. The survey will run until November 22nd, 2020.

After the survey is completed, I'll post the results as an article on this site, announcing it [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pwim) and via the newsletter. Like previous years, I'll post results in aggregate to avoid disclosing any personal information. This means the more responses the survey gets, the more interesting insights I'll be able to publish, so please help me out by answering the survey and sharing it with your peers.

A special thanks to everyone who responded to my request on Twitter for feedback on a draft of the survey, including [Ben Watanabe](https://twitter.com/benWTNB), [Paulo D'Alberti](https://twitter.com/pdalber), and [Clement Chidiac](https://twitter.com/Clementchidiac).

    <content type="html">Japan's [Employment Security Act](http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?id=10&amp;vm=2&amp;re=) requires a recruitment business to obtain a license. Failure to do so can result in imprisonment of up to a year. While I've met sleazy recruiters, sending them to prison seems a tad excessive to me. Curious about why the industry is so harshly regulated, I started digging. This took me into the seemingly dry but surprisingly interesting topic of the history of recruitment in Japan. As virtually nothing about this is written in English, I'm sharing what I found.

## Japan’s first employment agency

The earliest account of an employment agency in Japan comes from the mid-Seventeenth century. [Keian Yamato](http://shokugyo-kyokai.or.jp/shiryou/gyouseishi/01-1.html) was a doctor who was sometimes asked by his patients to introduce servants or help arrange marriages. He was compensated for these introductions, and eventually this side business grew so successful that it overtook his medical practice. In 1652, he quit his job as a doctor to focus on his introduction business instead. So much so was his early fame, that early employment agencies were called “Keian” after him.

Keian’s agency and others got started at that point in Japanese history because the economic conditions were right for them. For an employment agency to be a viable business, there needs to be both a large supply of people seeking employment, and employers seeking labor. By mid-Seventeenth century Japan, such a market for labor was flourishing in response to a shift in Japanese society that had started with the dawn of the Edo Period, fifty years earlier.

## The labour market in the Edo Period

The Edo period started in 1603 when [Ieyasu Tokugawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu) officially assumed control of Japan. Before he came to power, for the last century and a half, Japan had been in a state of near-constant civil war, leading to much of the country struggling to recover from the ongoing conflict.

Ieyasu chose Edo, modern day Tokyo, to be the center of his government and country. Previous to this, the political and cultural center was located in western Japan, and Edo and the surrounding region had been economically underdeveloped. But Ieyasu enacted policies that encouraged the urbanization of Edo, transforming it from a small castle town with only one hundred houses to a bustling metropolis of over 250,000 people by 1650.

Not only did Ieyasu pursue urbanization of Edo, but his policies encouraged it throughout Japan. The government divided all of Japan into specific regions, granting each to a local Daimyo, a powerful feudal lord, who built their own castles surrounded by Samurai residences. This lead to a growth in the number of artisans and merchants, who in turn needed staff, creating new employment opportunities.

Further driving demand for labour was the government policy of [Sankin-kōtai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankin-k%C5%8Dtai), which required Daimyo to alternate living between their holdings and Edo on a yearly basis, in an attempt to prevent them from gaining too much power. As it was infeasible for Daimyos to relocate their entire household to Edo, this led to a demand for temporary staff.

Simultaneously, Edo saw a large influx of job seekers. Traditionally in Japan, the eldest son inherited everything: the family name, business, and any assets. Other children were seen as a burden, particularly for poor families. Struggling families practiced “Kuchi-berashi”, literally translated as reducing the number of mouths, where they would place their children to work elsewhere. As Edo flourished, many second sons and daughters of poor rural families journeyed there in search of employment.

Not only did children seek employment in Edo, but so did adults. Often these were people from farming villages who were cast out by their family, or samurai who became masterless after their leader fell in battle.

As these job seekers didn’t have local connections, they sought out someone who could make introductions. With the burgeoning employment market, recruiting as a profession was born in Japan.

## Employment in the Edo period

Employment is a relationship where an employer pays an employee for work. While this has been one type of relationship, there are others where people perform work without receiving compensation, such as slavery or indentured servitude. In the Edo Period, the division between compensated and forced labor was ambiguous, with the term [Hōkō](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A5%89%E5%85%AC), roughly translated as “service” or “apprenticeship”, used to refer to a wide range of employment-like relationships.

The most straightforward kind of Hōkō was temporary labor, where a person tended to be paid daily. Another form was a long term contract of a year or more to work for a samurai house. With this contract, they were usually paid on a monthly or yearly basis, however the salary itself was low as they were also provided room and board while working for the family.

Unpaid apprenticeships also fall under the term Hōkō, whereby a person would work for an artisan or merchant to learn the business. While they usually wouldn’t be directly paid for their work, the expectation was that their previous employer would sponsor their new business.

Children could also be placed out to work under a Hōkō agreement, where they would often learn a craft while being given food, clothes, and a place to live, but not be directly financially compensated. The parents of the children would be given what was effectively an interest free loan: they’d get a lump sum payment when the child started the apprenticeship, which they’d need to pay back when it ended.

While Hōkō tended to refer to agreements of fixed duration, it also encompasses a slavery-like relationship, whereby a whole family was born to serve a wealthy family for their entire life. Near the beginning of the Edo period, this form of permanent Hōkō was banned, and restricted to a fixed period instead (a maximum of 3 years in 1616, but extended it to 10 years in 1625).

## Recruiter or human trafficker?

In modern parlance, just like there is a clear divide between employment and forced labour, there is also a clear divide between recruiters who perform employment matchmaking, and human traffickers who provide uncompensated labourers to employers. In the Edo period, the difference between these two professions was murkier than it is today.

For instance, when children ventured into Edo in search of employment and didn’t have any local connections, they would sometimes make use of a local recruiter. These recruiters would sign a contract on behalf of the parents with an employer. While some of these were benevolent, it was easy for them to be exploitative, and force the children to take jobs with poor working conditions.

During this period, the government also established special regions called [Yukaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%ABkaku), which became the only legal area to practice prostitution. The government saw Yukaku as a way of maintaining public order and collecting taxes. To ensure a steady stream of new prostitutes, the government allowed the “apprenticing” of young girls into prostitution. Unlike normal apprenticeships though, where the parents needed to pay back the “loan” that they received, the girl herself became responsible for paying it back. The amount the parents received was so much though, that even if the girl worked her entire life as a prostitute, she could never pay off the debt. The only way out was to have a wealthy man buy out her remaining debt, and become his mistress. Some recruiters took advantage of Yukaku, and effectively bought young girls from poor families in rural areas and sold them to brothels.

## First steps towards regulation of recruitment

In 1867, the Tokugawa shogunate was finally toppled, ushering in a new era in Japanese history, referred to as [the Meiji period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_(era)). Whereas the previous government had maintained an isolationist stance, the new government embraced western technology and culture, seeking to modernize the country before it was subjugated by western powers.

As part of this modernization, the government abolished the strict class system that divided Japanese into Samurai, peasants, artisans, and merchants, declaring that everyone who had been peasants, artisans, and merchants to be equal. People who were formerly Samurai and Daimyo however were still granted a status as nobles.

With this move modernity, the government sought to regulate the recruiting industry. In 1872, they introduced a requirement that recruiters be licensed and have a guarantor. They also limited the fee a recruiter could receive to be a maximum of 5% of the salary of the introduced employee. This fee was paid by both the employee and employer.

## International attempts to ban private employment agencies

As part of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I, [the International Labour Organization (ILO)](https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/history/lang--en/index.htm) was founded to advance social and economic justice through setting international labour standards.

At their very first meeting in 1919, the ILO called on its members to establish free public employment agencies and move towards banning fee charging agencies. As a member of the ILO, Japan created a new law, which required municipal governments to establish public employment agencies and introduced stricter requirements for private employment agencies. While there had been 9,712 private agencies in 1926, the number dwindled to 2,541 by 1934.

The new regulation of the industry also saw stronger controls against unethical recruitment, such as using exaggerated or false claims to recruit people, forcing applications, recruiting women to be prostitutes, blocking applicants’ freedom, and so on.

In April 1938, the public employment agencies that had been operated at a local level were nationalized with a new law. This law also banned private agencies, except for some of the existing agencies, which were allowed to continue while facing even stricter regulations. Many of the private agencies who were banned merged into the national agency. The driving factor for this nationalization was not human rights though, but rather a response to a rapid increase in demand by the military for labor due to [the Second Sino-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War).

## The loosening of regulations

With the end of World War II, the Allied occupation of Japan worked to reform the politics, society, economy, culture and all the other aspects of the country. The occupation also called for labour from the Japanese. The first request being to supply the US embassy with 200 gardeners, 110 cleaners, and two elevator mechanics. These requests increased over time, but the national employment agency was unable to fully meet them.

This unfulfilled demand was despite widespread unemployment in Tokyo. Due to the defeat in the war, there was an overwhelming mood of depression in the capital, and many people lost the motivation to find a proper job, instead subsisting as day labourers working at the black markets that had sprung up.

At this time, while fee charging agencies were still generally banned, there were certain professions that were considered exceptions, and licensed recruiters were permitted to make introductions. These included those in the field of art, music, and entertainment. In 1947, this list was expanded to include more jobs such as scientists, doctors, dentists, vets, pharmacists, lawyers and accountants. In 1948, it was expanded once more to include nurses and midwives. This list continued to be expanded until many different kinds of jobs were permitted.

In 1999, the law was drastically overhauled, moving from explicitly listing allowed jobs, to specifically excluding certain jobs. This shift reflected the government's concern that by needing to constantly update a list of permitted professions, they wouldn’t be able to quickly react to a diverse and sophisticated job market.

Along with this change, recruiting firms were also allowed charge a company up to 50% of the annual salary of a successful introduction. Previously, recruiting agencies could charge only a maximum of 10.1% of the six month salary after a successful introduction. Today, typically recruiters charge 30-35% of the salary, but in some cases, such as introducing an executive-level employee, or a highly in demand engineer, it is possible to receive a 50% fee.

This legal change transformed the recruiting industry in Japan. In 1996, there were only 300 recruiting agencies in Japan, most of which were small and only supplied housemaids, store clerks and other short term workers. However, just three years later in 1999, this number had more than tripled to 947 firms. Two years after that, in 2001, the number of firms had almost tripled again to 2,741. As of 2019, there are more than 20,000 firms, with more than 100 new firms being registered in Tokyo each month.

Criminal penalties for violating recruitment law remain, and though there are few modern examples of people being arrested for practicing recruiting without a license remain, they do exist, such as in 2009, when [a Chinese national was allegedly arrested](https://www.vrp-p.jp/blog/20100122160/) for introducing workers without a license, and in 2017, when [a Yakuza was arrested](https://www.asahi.com/articles/DA3S13154523.html) for recruiting people to decontaminate Fukushima Daiichi power plant without a license. That these penalties remain are largely an artifact of the laws evolving from a much earlier time, when recruitment was a profession that walked the line between introducing employment and selling people themselves.

    <content type="html">With TokyoDev, this site, my goal is to help international software developers start and grow their career in Japan. Being a developer myself, it's been tempting to come up with technical solutions to do this. But I've realized that rather than writing code, my time is better spent doing things like writing articles, helping companies refine their job postings, and answering readers' questions. Keeping with this philosophy, the site is quite simple from a technical perspective: it's a collection of HTML and CSS files built by the static site generator [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).

Recently though, I had something I wanted to do that ended up being relatively complicated from a technical perspective: automatically generate "social images" that show up when my articles, job postings, and so on are shared on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. For an example of this, see the following tweet.

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;How I generate social images, like the one attached to this tweet, for TokyoDev. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hVUYw208xG"&gt;https://t.co/hVUYw208xG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Paul McMahon (@pwim) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pwim/status/1266204384628703233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 29, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Specifying an image to use for a given page is straightforward: just use [the Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) to specify an `og:image` (though Twitter requires [some tweaks](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started) for an optimal experience). Generating the images themselves is a bit more involved though.

## My strategy for generating images

I'd noticed the software developer community site [DEV](https://dev.to/) dynamically generates these images. As I remembered they'd open sourced much of their site, it seemed a good place to start. Indeed, I was able to quickly track down [how they did it](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/blob/master/app/controllers/social_previews_controller.rb): dynamically construct HTML, and then use the service [HTML/CSS to Image API](https://hcti.io/) (HCTI API) to convert that to an image.

Overall, the strategy of converting HTML to an image was attractive to me as it meant I could continue to use a single tool for building my site. I could theoretically use a tool like [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) to overlay text on a base image, but that would both require me to learn a new technology, and make it harder to delegate the creation of the image templates to [my designer](https://mathieumayer.com/).

## Using HCTI API with a static site

With HCTI API, you supply the source HTML via a POST request, and get back a URL for the resulting image. You can supply them this in two ways:

1. Use the `html` parameter to supply actual html to render
2. Use the `url` parameter to specify a public html page to render

Since TokyoDev is a static site, I had a finite number of social images that I want to generate at build time. To do this, the first option, passing HTML to the API seemed the right approach, as at build time, I could easily generate that HTML locally.

However, I quickly ran into an issue. I wanted to display the company logo associated with a job posting in the social image. To embed an image like this, I'd need to make it publicly accessible somewhere first, so that HCTI API could fetch it. Doing this was certainly possible, but would make things more complicated.

If I was going to need to make the image publicly accessible at build time anyways, I might as well just make the whole social image page available, and use the `url` option instead. Since building and publishing such a page is exactly what Middleman is designed to do, that part was easy. The challenging part was setting a page's `og:image` URL to point to the image generated by HCTI API.

While there's a number of approaches I could have taken, I thought the easiest approach would be to create a small proxy for HCTI API. When this proxy received a request, it would generate an image with HCTI API and then redirect to that URL. This would mean I could set the `og:image` URL to something like `https://hcti-proxy.tokyodev.com/2020/05/29/generating-social-images-with-static-site-generators/`, and thus wouldn't need the social image source page to be publicly accessible at build time.

With a couple hours of work, I successfully had social images for my site. [I released the proxy](https://github.com/pwim/hcti-proxy), and thought since it was an interesting topic, I'd write an article about it.

## Pursuing a nicer solution

The solution I'd made was good enough. From a rational business perspective that should have been the end of it. But something was still nagging at me: I'd introduced a dynamic component to my static site, and one that was theoretically not needed. The "right" approach would be to generate the images themselves locally. That way, I could do it at build time, ensuring there was one less thing that could go subtly wrong.

Middleman is written in Ruby, and as as Ruby developer I'm familiar with the automated acceptance testing framework [capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara). One of its features is the ability to take the screenshot of a page. Another is to use selenium to drive  Chrome in headless mode. Put these together, and I'd be able to generate my social images locally while building the site.

The rest is just implementation details. After spending much too much time, I created a middleman extension, [Middleman::SocialImage](https://github.com/pwim/middleman-social_image) that takes care of the heavy lifting. If you're interested, check it out! It's still rough around the edges, so I'd love feedback on it.

    <title>COVID-19 and IT Jobs in Japan</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/covid-19-and-it-jobs-in-japan"/>
    <id>https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/covid-19-and-it-jobs-in-japan</id>

    <updated>2020-05-15T13:38:00+09:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content type="html">The COVID-19 pandemic has created a lot of uncertainty among prospective job seekers, especially those looking to relocate to Japan from overseas. To help people understand the current situation with regards to IT jobs in Japan, I contacted [every company using TokyoDev](/companies), asking them three questions:

1. How has your business been impacted by COVID-19?
2. How are you handling the COVID-19 situation with regards to employees?
3. What's your approach to overseas candidates while travel restrictions are in place?

Based on their answers, and companies who proactively contacted about the situation, I talked to a total of sixteen companies. Although this is obviously a small number for the market as a whole, I think their answers are representative of tech companies in Japan that specifically hire foreign engineers.

## Business impact of COVID-19 and hiring

For the majority of companies, this pandemic has yet to significantly effect their business. Many told me that it created new challenges, but those were balanced out by new opportunities. Because of this, these companies have tended to continue hiring as before the crisis, though due to the unpredictability of the situation a couple have implemented a general hiring freeze.

An exception to this were companies servicing the hospitality industry, which has been incredibly hard hit. While these business are pursuing new opportunities created by this crisis, they're needing to minimize their expenses in the face of uncertainty, and so have halted on hiring.

On the other hand, a couple of companies reported that this crisis has led to a tremendous increase in demand for their services. Specifically, [DMM Eikaiwa](/companies/dmm-eikaiwa), which provides an online language learning platform, has seen huge user growth and even bigger utilization during this crisis. Also, [Degica](/companies/degica), who has many big clients in the gaming industry, is seeing record volume, and said they opened a [Site Reliability Engineer](/companies/degica/jobs/site-reliability-engineer) position specifically to help them keep up with the demand the crisis is causing.

Besides the companies I'm already listing on TokyoDev, I had two companies who had never before used TokyoDev contact me about posting new opportunities. These are the first new inbound leads I've gotten in a couple of months, and a sign that more companies are thinking about hiring. This is probably due to the cautiously optimistic outlook on the domestic situation, with [the state of emergency being lifted in most of Japan](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200514_33/).

## Treatment of employees during COVID-19

Japanese companies have traditionally been opposed to remote work. While the companies I list tend to be more progressive, most still didn't allow remote work. Those that did have a remote policy tended to only allow it one or two days a week, still requiring employees to come in to the office regularly.

With this crisis, all the companies I spoke with have switched to working completely remotely. While some indicated they plan to revert to going into the office after the situation stabilizes, others have indicated that remote work is going smoother than they anticipated, and they will probably revise their policies towards it after the crisis.

A particular challenge with remote work in Tokyo is that many people have living arrangements that assume most of the time everyone will be out. For instance, a family with two working parents and a child might live in a one bedroom apartment. With daycares and schools being shutdown, having both parents working normally can become incredibly challenging, if not impossible.

Normally Japanese companies, even startups, tend not to be so accommodating to the needs of individuals, and rather have blanket policies for everyone. However, in this situation, it seems that most companies, at least those that I'm connected to, are being understanding of individual needs, and finding some arrangement that allows their employees to continue to work.

Another issue with working from home is that employees may not have the equipment they need to do their job. While in general, developers often have a good home setup, I've heard that others may not even have internet at home (they just use their smartphone for surfing the net, and don't have any computer of their own). Companies have mentioned they're providing financial support to help with these expenses.

## COVID-19 and applying for a job from overseas

Travel restrictions currently make it almost impossible for non-Japanese citizens to get into the country. Additionally, while Japanese immigration is accepting applications for Certificates of Eligibility, the first step in obtaining a visa, processing applications may take significantly more time than normal.

Because of this, it's currently impossible to relocate most developers to Japan. In response to this, two of the companies, LINE and [beBit](/companies/bebit), moved to only recruiting local developers. [HENNGE](/companies/hennge) said they'd still recruit internationally, but would wait until restrictions were lifted to have the candidate actually start working. The remaining companies said they'd hire overseas people on a remote contract until the restrictions are lifted and visas are processed. These companies still desire candidates to move to Japan, and so there's not yet been a shift to hiring remote developers globally from a longer term perspective.

While this situation makes it challenging for a company to commit to hire an overseas developer, at least during the interviewing process, it's perhaps a more even playing field than before. Japanese companies have traditionally relied heavily on in person interviews, with remote interviewing often being an afterthought. With this crisis though, all interviews are being moved online, and so should be conducted in a similar manner whether you're already living in Japan or not.

## Uncertainty means more risk and opportunity

This situation continues to evolve. The companies who are continuing to hire as normal tend to be smaller startups, and so should the situation progress, they may quickly change their stance on hiring. This makes it a risky time to change jobs, especially one in another country.

If you're not in Japan yet, you should understand what will happen if you quit your job to accept one in Japan, and either the offer is withdrawn before you move, or they hire you as a contractor and then terminate your contract.

If you do make it to Japan, or are already based here, you should similarly understand what will happen should a job offer be withdrawn or you are terminated. I'll outline the basics, but please research it in more detail yourself.

Under normal circumstances, full employees have relatively good protection from being fired or laid off, and from a cultural perspective, companies usually only seek to lay off employees as a last resort. If you are terminated, and have been enrolled in Japanese unemployment insurance for at least six months, you're eligible for benefits.

Working visas in Japan are not typically tied to your employer, making it easy to change jobs once you're here. If you're actively seeking employment, you can ostensibly stay in Japan until your visa expires.

Japan has a national health insurance system that makes it affordable for everyone to receive medical care, and you're eligible to benefit from it immediately upon enrolling.

All residents of Japan as of April 27th, including foreigners, are eligible for a one time payment of ¥100,000 (though as of this article, I'm not aware of people actually receiving the money).

Because of the increased risk of the unknown in this situation, people that require stability, such as those with dependents, tend to stay put. This means if you are in a position where you can take more risk, you may be able to take advantage of opportunities you might not otherwise have.

    <title>Visas for Software Engineers in Japan</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/japanese-engineering-visa-options"/>
    <id>https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/japanese-engineering-visa-options</id>

    <content type="html">Obtaining a working visa that lets you [work as software engineer in Japan](/articles/first-job-programmer-japan) is relatively easy compared to other countries. It costs a company almost nothing to sponsor your visa, there aren't any quotas on the number of visas issued, and the requirements to qualify for a visa itself are low.

The most common visa for software engineers in Japan is the Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa, which is trivial to obtain if you have a related university degree in a related subject like Computer Science or Software Engineering.

However, many great software engineers don't come from a traditional background, and with things like coding bootcamps becoming more common, this is only set to increase. Even if you don't have a related university degree, it may still be possible to qualify for a visa. However, determining which visa you're eligibile for becomes more challenging.

Many Japanese companies aren't aware of all the options to obtain a visa, and so it falls to you to educate yourself about the options, and find one that suits your situation. **When you apply for a software development job without a relevant degree, you should indicate which visa you're eligible for as part of your application, along with your reasoning why you're eligible.** If you don't do this, chances are good that a company will discard your application as soon as they seem you lack a relevant degree, as they'll assume you're not eligible for a visa.

This article documents all the paths to obtaining a visa that allow you to work full time as a software developer in Japan that I'm aware of. I should note I'm not an immigration specialist, and though I've done my best to fact check these approaches with Japanese immigration, you ultimately should do your due diligence.

Specifically, this article covers the following scenarios:

* [University degree related to engineering](#esi-visa-university-degree-engineering)
* [University degree unrelated to engineering](#esi-visa-university-degree-non-engineering)
* [Eligible for the Highly-Skilled Foreign Professional Visa](#hsfp)
* [Existing Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa](#existing-esi) (e.g. you're working for an English conversation school)
* [Ten years professional experience](#esi-visa-work-experience)
* [Passing an approved IT Exam](#esi-it-exam)
* [Eligible for a working holiday visa](#working-holiday)
* [Have graduated from a top 100 university](#jfind-visa)
* [Employer has a branch in Japan](#intra-company-transfer)
* [You start a Japanese company](#business-manager-visa)

Note that this article doesn't cover visas that rely on specific relationships (e.g. having a Japanese spouse) or that only allow you to work part time (e.g. being a student in Japan).

&lt;h2 id="esi-visa-university-degree-engineering"&gt;University degree related to "engineering"&lt;/h2&gt;

As mentioned in the introduction, the default route to a working visa in Japan as a software developer is the Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa via a related university degree.

To meet the requirement, you must hold a degree equivalent to one granted by Japanese universities, including junior colleges (短期大学), or have graduated from a vocational school (専門学校).  While overseas universities and graduate schools are accepted, vocational schools outside of Japan are typically not accepted. So if you have a degree like a Bachelor's or Master's, it is clear you're eligible for a visa, but otherwise eligibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis. For those graduating for something other than a university, Takumi Nakamura, an immigration consultant, [wrote](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/visas-for-hiring-foreigners-in-japan), "In my experience, an Associate Degree has a high chance of being accepted, while a Diploma or Certificate has a high chance of being rejected."

The degree must also be related to engineering. As the "Engineer" designation is used for positions that require knowledge of technology, physical science, natural science, or engineering, a degree related to any of these topics could theoretically be used to obtain a visa as a software engineer. One in a subject like computer science or software engineering is best though, as it is undisputedly related to working as a software developer. That being said, as each application is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, it's impossible to say with certainty if a specific degree would qualify.

&lt;h2 id="esi-visa-university-degree-non-engineering"&gt;University degree unrelated to "engineering"&lt;/h2&gt;

When you change careers to software development, you may have previously obtained a degree in a completely unrelated field. It may be that degree qualifies you for a position with a job title that's not something like "Software Engineer", but still involves coding.

For example, if the position emphasized your English communication ability over your technical ability, it's possible that the position could be considered to fall under the "Specialist in Humanities" portion of the Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa. With that classification, degrees with majors like English are allowed, and so it opens up some options.

The downside to this approach is it increases the uncertainty for the company sponsoring your visa, and may require them to tailor a position to your unique skillset. Because of this, for a company to agree to go down this route, they'll need to believe you're a truly exceptional candidate, and one that is far more qualified than anyone else they can find.

&lt;h2 id="hsfp"&gt;Highly-Skilled Foreign Professional Visa&lt;/h2&gt;

The [Highly-Skilled Foreign Professional Visa](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001398892.pdf) is a visa that is tied to your employer, not a specific industry.

To be eligible for a visa, you need 70 points. Points are given for things like academic background, professional experience, salary of the position, age, and a number of miscellaneous things, most notably Japanese language ability (i.e. having passed JLPT N1 or N2). As long as you meet the threshold of 70 points, you are eligible for the visa. A university degree is not required provided you can obtain enough points from other sources.

An example of someone who qualified for this visa would be a person who held a Bachelors degree (10 points), had three years work experience (5 points), was 29 years old or under (15 points), passed N2 (10 points), and earned a salary of least ¥8 million / year (30 points).

Because of how points are calculated, you probably won't be able to obtain this visa for an entry level job, but for those people with some experience, but less than ten years, it's a good option.

&lt;h2 id="existing-esi"&gt;Existing Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa&lt;/h2&gt;

When applying for your initial Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa, your background needs to be relevant to the position at the company that's sponsoring you. However, while you have the visa, you're allowed to change jobs to any position permitted by the visa as a whole, even to one unrelated to your academic or professional experience. So if you have this visa, you can work as a software developer in Japan, regardless of how you initially obtatined it.

As this visa is the one used for teachers at English conversation schools, a position for which virtually any university degree is accepted, it opens up a relatively easy route to Japan: come initially as an English conversation teacher and then later find a job as a software developer.

This sounds like it might be a grey area, but I've specifically confirmed with immigration that it is permitted. Furthermore, they told me when renewing this visa, they only cares that you have a university degree, not that of a specific major. So if a company hires you as a software developer on this visa, you should be able to stay in Japan indefinitely.

&lt;h2 id="esi-visa-work-experience"&gt;Ten years professional experience&lt;/h2&gt;

If you have at least ten years of professional experience as a software developer, you're eligible for the Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa, even if you don't have any university degree. Unfortunately there are no clear guidelines about this route, and the only way you'll know for sure whether you'll get a visa is to go through the application process itself.

From talking to immigration, they seem to be fairly flexible as to what kind of work experience they're willing to consider. For instance, in addition to full time employment as a software developer, freelance or even part time work can be counted. I've been told explicitly that experience as an intern won't be counted though. For documenting your experience, there's no set format, and immigration advises you to use whatever you can to prove you were an employee, such as a letter of employment or a contract.

Education can also be counted towards this ten years. For instance, if you started to study computer science but dropped out, or if you obtained an associate diploma in something IT related. Again, to prove this experience, there's no set format, so you can use whatever you have, such as a transcript or diploma.

The main downside of this approach is the uncertainty it creates. If you've spent ten years working for big name tech companies like Microsoft or Google, there's probably not much of a worry that you wouldn't get a visa. But if you're trying to cobble together experience from different sources and just meet the ten years benchmark, your in a much more uncertain situation and might have trouble finding a company that's willing to sponsor you.

&lt;h2 id="esi-it-exam"&gt;Passing an approved IT exam&lt;/h2&gt;

If you have passed one of [the approved exams](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/laws/nyukan_hourei_h09.html) by Japan's Ministry of Justice, the normal requirement for an Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa of a related university degree or ten years work experience will be waived. Currently, exams are offered in India, Singapore, Korea, China, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Bangladesh.

Of these exams, the only eligible exam that is clearly available to citizens of any country is the [PhilNITS](http://www.philnits.org/) Fundamental Information Technology Engineers Examination. I've heard of several non-filipinos who have taken this exam and used it to get a visa in Japan, including a guy who made [a youtube video about his experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-sYsR8vQU).

The exam covers topics both of both a practical and theoretical nature, and you'll most likely need to study for it. Luckily, there's [a study guide](http://www.philnits.org/materials.html) available, and you can see [past exam questions](http://www.itpec.org/pastexamqa/fe.html) as well.

Here's a couple of sample questions from past exams

&gt; 1) What is the Hamming distance of bit strings 10101 and 11110?

&gt; 2) A candy box contains four flavors of candies: 6 lemon-flavored, 12 strawberry-flavored, 8 orange-flavored, and 4 grape-flavored. When a candy is randomly chosen from the box, what is the probability that it is either lemon- or orange-flavored?

&gt; 3) Which of the following is an e-mail header field that is removed during the message transfer using SMTP?
&gt; a) Bcc b) Date c) Received d) X-Mailer

As you only need 60 out of 100 total points to pass, it looks like the bar is relatively low. One person I talked to told me it took them about a month of studying to be ready to pass it.

Beyond the time needed to study for it, the other downsides to this approach is that you'll need to fly to Manila to take it, and that it is only offered two times per year. The cost of the exam itself is only 2,100 PHP, or roughly 40 USD.

Besides making you eligible for an Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa, passing any approved exam will also give you 5 points towards a Highly-Skilled Foreign Professional Visa.

&lt;h2 id="working-holiday"&gt;Working Holiday visa&lt;/h2&gt;

The [Working Holiday visa](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/w_holiday/index.html) doesn't require a specific education or work background, but rather the primary requirements are that you're a citizen of a country that has an agreement with Japan and are under a specific age (typically, 30 years or under). As the intention of the visa is for you to work to support your holiday, you shouldn't have a job offer in place when you obtain it. However, once you're in Japan, it allows you to do virtually any job, with no restrictions on hours or employment status.

This visa is ideal for someone at the beginning of their career as a software developer, who wants to try living in Japan, and is willing to move here with the risk that they won't be able to find any employment. Because companies can have you start working immediately, without needing to relocate you or apply for a visa, it opens up opportunities you wouldn't have otherwise.

If you don't meet the conditions of a normal working visa, it can also be a great option to try living here before investing in meeting the criteria for one.

Because this visa is a fixed duration, eventually it will expire, and if you want to continue living in Japan, you'll need to switch visa statuses. As a Canadian, I initially came to Japan on a Working Holiday visa, then found full time employment as a software developer, and so when the Working Holiday visa was going to expire, my company sponsored a normal working visa. During the renewal period I was able to continue living and working in Japan.

However, it seems that while citizens of Australia, Canada, South Korea, New Zealand and Germany can change the visa from a working holiday visa to a normal working visa without leaving the country, those from other countries may not be able to. Each case is individually reviewed by immigration though, and so it's impossible to guarantee the outcome.

Even if you are forced to leave the country at the end of your working holiday, if you've proved yourself as a valuable member of a company that's hired you, they'll probably be willing to sponsor a normal working visa, and may even do something like allow you to work remotely while it is being processed.

&lt;h2 id="jfind-visa"&gt;Have graduated from a top 100 university&lt;/h2&gt;

The [J-Find Visa](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/how-i-obtained-japan-s-j-find-visa) enables you to come to Japan to hunt for a job, and should you find one, start working immediately. It requires that you have a degree from a university ranked in the top 100 in at least two world university rankings, apply within 5 years of graduating, and have a minimum of 200,000 yen for initial living expenses. 

This option seems similar to a working holiday visa, and could be an alternative for someone from a country that doesn't have a working holiday program with Japan, or is too old to obtain that visa.

&lt;h2 id="intra-company-transfer"&gt;Employer has a branch in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;

If you're working for an international company that has a branch or subsidiary in Japan (or for the branch or subsidiary of a Japanese company), and the company relocates you to their office here, you can use the Intra-Company Transferee visa. This visa only requires that you've worked for the company for at least one year, and so even if you don't have a university degree you can obtain it. With the visa though, you're supposed to be only relocated for a fixed duration, such as a two-year contract.

Because it requires that you already be working for a company for one year, it's not an option for most people who are proactively looking to relocate to Japan. Theoretically you could seek out employment at a company in your own country with offices in Japan, but it's unlikely that even if you do obtain such a job, you'll be able to get a guarantee of relocation to Japan further down the line.

&lt;h2 id="business-manager-visa"&gt;You start a Japanese company&lt;/h2&gt;

Rather than working as a full time employee for another company, you can theoretically [start your own business in Japan](/articles/creating-company-japan), and obtain the business manager visa, which doesn't require a university degree or a specific number of years of experience.

Approval for this visa is on a case by case basis, but in principle you'll need to invest at least ¥5 million in the company you create, rent a dedicated office, and have a viable business plan. Most likely, you'll need professional help establishing the company, which will probably cost you ¥1 to ¥2 million (though this can be paid from your initial investment in the company).

One of our readers wrote an article on [how he obtained a business manager visa](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/obtaining-a-business-manager-visa-in-japan) while essentially having a single client, so if you have enough resources, it's theoretically an option.</content>

    <title>2019 International Developer in Japan Survey Results</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/japan-developer-salaries"/>
    <id>https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/japan-developer-salaries</id>
    <published>2020-01-07T10:00:00+09:00</published>
    <updated>2020-01-07T10:00:00+09:00</updated>

    <content type="html">*This survey has become a yearly thing. Browse [all our survey results](/insights).*

If you're an international software developer looking for a job in Japan, it can be hard to tell what your market rate is. Sure, there's data (in Japanese) for the market as a whole, but that doesn't necessarily reflect the kind of positions that international software developers hold here. So to better shed a light on [software developer salaries in Japan](/articles/software-developer-salaries-in-japan), I conducted a survey of international developers working in Japan. The following results are based on the average total yearly salary (including bonuses) reported by respondents.

## Salary by years of experience in software development

Years of experience    | Salary      | Respondents
-----------------------|-------------|------------
Under 2 years          | ¥4 million  | 19 people
2 to 3 years           | ¥6 million  | 32 people
4 to 7 years           | ¥8 million  | 62 people
8 to 15 years          | ¥9 million  | 57 people
Over 16 years          | ¥11 million | 19 people

The compensation for developers participating in my survey is significantly better than that of a typical Japanese one.

For instance, [this 2018 survey](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/toukei/itiran/roudou/chingin/kouzou/z2018/index.html) conducted by the Japanese government found that the average "System Engineer" (a roughly analogous position to a software developer) in Japan had 12 years of experience and an annual compensation of ¥5.5 million.

## Salary by English / Japanese usage

English usage | Japanese usage | Salary     | Respondents
--------------|----------------|------------|------------
Never         | Frequently     | ¥6 million | 17 people
Sometimes     | Frequently     | ¥7 million | 22 people
Frequently    | Never          | ¥8 million | 37 people
Frequently    | Sometimes      | ¥8 million | 83 people
Frequently    | Frequently     | ¥9 million | 28 people

I think there's two factors at play that explain why people who use primarily Japanese at their job tend to get paid worse than those using English.

First, English ability is something that is exceptional in Japan, and so if a company wants to hire an English speaking developer, they need to pay a premium for it.

Secondly, companies that recruit English speaking developers with little to no Japanese skill also tend to be looking for technical excellence, and thus are willing to pay higher salaries.

## Salary by Industry

Industry   | Salary      | Respondents
-----------|-------------|-------------
E-commerce | ¥8 million  | 17 people
Finance    | ¥11 million | 28 people
Games      | ¥5 million  | 11 people
SaaS       | ¥7 million  | 23 people
Other      | ¥8 million  | 103 people

Respondents were spread across a wide range of industries, and in these results I'm only including the industries with at least ten respondents, so most of them fell into the "Other" bucket.

## Salary by company size

Employee count | Salary      | Respondents
---------------|-------------|------------
Under 30       | ¥7 million  | 42 people
30 to 99       | ¥6 million  | 40 people
100 to 300     | ¥7 million  | 33 people
300 to 1999    | ¥9 million  | 23 people
2000 and over  | ¥11 million | 48 people

As a general trend, the larger the company, the better the pay. Curiously, there's a small dip in pay going from a very small company of under thirty people, to a slightly larger one.

## Salary by Programming Language

Rank | Language   | Salary      | Respondents
------------------|-------------|------------
1    | Go         | ¥10 million | 20 people
2    | Java       | ¥10 million | 34 people
3    | Kotlin     | ¥9 million  | 12 people
4    | Python     | ¥9 million  | 41 people
5    | TypeScript | ¥8 million  | 18 people
6    | Ruby       | ¥8 million  | 53 people
7    | C++        | ¥8 million  | 16 people
8    | Swift      | ¥8 million  | 15 people
9    | JavaScript | ¥7 million  | 84 people
10   | PHP        | ¥6 million  | 11 people
11   | C#         | ¥6 million  | 17 people

People could include multiple programming languages in their response, hence JavaScript being the most popular programming language.

The relative ranking of compensation by programming language is roughly similar to [this Japanese ranking](https://www.bizreach.co.jp/pressroom/pressrelease/2018/0807.html), though compensation in that ranking is much lower across the board. Java seems to be the main outlier in my results, falling in second place in my survey, but not making the top ten in that ranking.

## Salary by location

Prefecture    | Salary     | Respondents
--------------|------------|------------
Greater Tokyo | ¥8 million | 168 people
Elsewhere     | ¥5 million | 23 people

Most opportunities for software developers in Japan are in Tokyo. 88% of respondents were working for a company with offices in the greater Tokyo area (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama).

## Survey Methodology

I announced the survey through the TokyoDev mailing list, and through my personal social media channels such as Twitter. As such, the results are biased towards that of fluent English speakers (though often non-native speakers).

219 people in total responded to the survey. However, after restricting responses to those who said they were living in Japan, working for a company with offices in Japan, and were not Japanese citizens, and included a salary that was not so high or low to be an obvious typo, I whittled that down to 191 results.

When breaking down the results, I rounded to the nearest million yen, as I thought any more precise numbers would imply a significance that isn't there.

    <title>Safari bug with ruby tag</title>

    <content type="html">*Update (November 8th, 2019): [Juanito Fatas](https://juanitofatas.com/) has pointed out to me this bug has now been fixed.*

Safari 12.1.1 has a strange issue with certain ruby tags. Specifically, something like

    &lt;ruby&gt;ホゲホゲ&lt;rp&gt;（&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ホゲホゲ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;）&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;

which renders as

&lt;ruby&gt;ホゲホゲ&lt;rp&gt;（&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ホゲホゲ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;）&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;

If you control click on the above, and then click somewhere else on the page, Safari crashes with "This webpage was reloaded because a problem appeared."

We use the ruby tag in [Doorkeeper](https://www.doorkeeper.jp/) for showing the reading of event participant names, as in Japanese, it can be non-obvious how to read the kanji. However, due to this bug, it appears that clicking on event participants names now causes Safari to crash under certain circumstances, making it a more serious issue then it might first appear to be.

I tried reporting it via the only [Safari feedback form](https://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html) I could find, but I doubt that it gets much attention, so I'd love it if someone knows a better way of reporting issues like this.

    <content type="html">When you have a business where customers subscribe to a monthly plan, and you have new customers signing up every month, it feels like your revenue will keep growing forever. However, as customers will also cancel their subscriptions (churn), eventually your growth will flatline.

Calculating this growth ceiling is actually quite simple:

```
Growth ceiling = (New customers / Churn rate) * ARPU
```

I've found it to be a useful exercise to make a spreadsheet where I derive the growth ceiling:

&lt;table style="width: auto" class="unstriped"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Prompted to start trial&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Form completion rate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trials&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trial-to-paid conversion rate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;50%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;New customers&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Churn rate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ARPU&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$40&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Growth ceiling&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$8,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Not only does knowing your growth ceiling help with future planning, it also gives you a simple model to experiment with, where you can tweak different numbers to see how they'll effect future growth of your business.

    <title>All code is technical debt</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/all-code-is-technical-debt"/>

    </author>
    <content type="html">Technical debt, as originally [coined by Ward Cunningham](http://wiki.c2.com/?WardExplainsDebtMetaphor), is the idea that you can gain a temporary speed boost by rushing software development, at the cost of slowing down future development.

This acts like a loan. With a loan, you can borrow money to accomplish something faster than you could otherwise. With technical debt, this is like the initial development boost you get. Once you take out a loan, you need to pay interest on it. With technical debt, this is like how future development will slow down. When you pay down the principal of a loan, the interest gets smaller. This is similar to refactoring, where you spend time improving code to speed up future development.

Like financial debt, technical debt can be a useful tool. Sometimes the short term gains you get outweigh the long term consequences. However, just like taking on too much financial debt can lead to bankruptcy, letting too much technical debt accumulate can cause your product development to slow to a crawl.

If you've ever created a new application from scratch, you've experienced the wonderful feeling of working on a project without any technical debt. When you're first building out an application, you can develop new features at incredible speed. There's no need to worry about the impact on existing users. You can just focus on implementing new features.

However, as an application matures, development speed will inevitably slow down. On a poorly implemented product, development speed slows down quickly. But even on a beautifully implemented one, development speed still slows down over time. As the more code you add to an application, the slower development becomes, I view all code as technical debt.

## Adding new assumptions increases debt

As an application matures, it collects a fundamental set of assumptions it makes. When you're starting a new project, you have no features at all, so there are no assumptions built into your codebase. This makes adding a new feature as simple as implementing the feature itself. However, once your project has its first feature, you'll forever need to consider the assumptions all the features you've developed so far impose on future development.

I'll give an example of how technical debt from core assumptions accumulates based on my experience creating [Doorkeeper](https://www.doorkeeper.jp/), an event platform for communities, which helps organisers of networking events, seminars, and user groups attract participants and manage registration.

We started Doorkeeper to help a local networking event, Mobile Monday Tokyo, make their registration and check in process smoother. For their event, they needed only a single, simple registration flow, where you couldn't do more than register for an event and cancel your registration.

As we expanded Doorkeeper to meet the needs of other organisers, we discovered many of them had a hard cap on attendance, something that wasn't a concern for Mobile Monday. To meet the needs of new organisers, we decided to add an option to limit the number of participants.

Having a limited number of participants for an event built on top of our existing assumption that people could register for an event, but we also needed to decide what would happen when someone tries to register for a full event. The simplest solution would have been to block people from registering when it was full, but we thought that gives a disappointing experience to potential participants, and also didn't give the organiser any feedback about how popular their event was. So we implemented a waitlist feature, where if someone went to register and the event was full, they'd join a waitlist instead. If someone attending the event cancelled their registration, the first person on the waitlist would get their spot.

The next feature we added was prepayment for an event. If our only assumption was "people can register for an event", this would be straightforward to do, as it builds on top of that assumption. But we also need to look at our other assumptions.

Depending on the event, the organiser may or may not want to allow prepaid participants to cancel. Furthermore, they might want to set up some sort of cancellation policy, where depending on when a participant cancelled, they'd get a partial refund. Because of all the edge cases involved with cancelling prepaid registrations, and that it was something most organisers didn't want to make too easy, we opted to not allow participants to cancel prepaid registrations themselves. Instead, they'd need to contact the organiser, who could then choose how to handle the situation.

Furthermore, because only a limited number of people could register for an event, we'd need some mechanism to ensure we only let people prepay for a spot they could actually get. To do this, we divided the registration process into two steps: first they entered their registration details, next they went on to payment. If the event filled up between the time they started filling out the initial form and submitted it, they'd join the waitlist.

We also needed to handle the case when they submitted the initial form, but never completed payment. To do this, we added an automatic cancellation of unpaid reservations after a certain amount of time.

We also needed to handle people being moved off the waitlist. For prepaid events, we couldn't issue their tickets immediately, as instead they needed to come back to the site to complete payment.

As you can see, adding new features became more and more complicated, as we needed to consider the implications off all the assumptions we'd added so far.

## Features can have negative value

For a feature to add value to your product, it needs to be useful to users. Features can have a negative value when the technical debt they add to your product outweighs the value they add to it.

An example I've seen of a feature that often creates negative value is localisation. At its simplest, localisation is translating your app into multiple languages. There's more challenges involved than just translation, but lets consider localisation in its simplest form: having a dictionary of language specific strings.

As a first step, this means you can never hard code a string in your application, which adds an extra layer of abstraction. This doesn't add much overhead, but it is still something your developers always need to keep in mind.

You also need to introduce a translation step into your development process. Assuming your developers aren't native speakers of all the languages you're supporting, they can no longer come up with strings themselves, and need to rely on translators. Again, you can work around this, but it still makes all future development a bit slower.

If localisation produces a large amount of value, this overhead isn't an issue. But I often see apps that do a half-assed job of localising, with the hope people from other countries will start using it. That's not how it works though. Unless you're willing to invest in doing a great job of localising and marketing your app in the languages you support, the localisation won't create value. So you end up with a feature that creates more debt than its worth.

## Code isn't inherently valuable

As developers, it's tempting to think we're creating value by writing code. However, the value of software comes from the usefulness of it to users, not the quality of our code. Poorly written code that does a useful task is more valuable than beautifully implemented code that does a useless one.

Because of this, we need to ensure we're working on valuable features. While traditionally development processes have assumed an omnipotent product owner, who somehow knows the relative value of features, that isn't really the case.

Hopefully you're already working with other stakeholders and have a good understanding of why what you're working on is valuable. But if you don't, push back. Try to uncover why they believe the feature is valuable and what sort of verification of this has been done.

By making sure the features we implement are valuable, we reduce the chance that the debt they create will be too much of a burden.

## Once a feature has been added, it's there to stay

Part of the reason we need to be so vigilant against features that don't produce sufficient value is that once a feature has been added, it's almost always there to stay.

Even when it becomes apparent after the fact that the feature isn't performing as well as we anticipated, the typical approach is to do nothing. Part of this is the sunk cost fallacy. Often there is the hope that even if the feature isn't used today, it will be in the future.

But there's also a legitimate reason for doing nothing. Removing a feature also has a cost, both in the development effort needed to cleanly remove it, and in potentially upsetting customers. So once a feature is added to a product, it is almost always there to stay.

## To avoid technical debt, don't write code

The only sure-fire way of avoiding technical debt is to not write code in the first place. As developers our first instinct is to solve a problem by coding, but that's not always the best strategy. Often times, we need to push aside that instinct.

A personal example is [a job board I run](/jobs) that helps international developers find jobs in Japan. I started by just posting jobs I came across, but eventually heard of enough success stories that I figured companies would be willing to pay for it. As part of this, I wanted to do some basic screening of applications for spam before they went to the company,.

To do this, I started building a screening system using Ruby on Rails. However, after about a day of development, I realised that making a system that worked better than having the candidates send emails was rather complex. I'd need to replicate all the features baked into email: attachments, communication between the candidates and companies, and so on. What's more, I'd need to ensure the system actually stayed up, monitoring logs and what not.

What I really needed was just a way to moderate the emails before they went to the company. So instead of continuing down the path of implementing something myself, I just used the Groups feature of Google apps to set up a mailing list for each company. While this wasn't the optimal technical solution, ultimately the value I was creating wasn't about the technology. Rather, my time was better spent helping companies and candidates find each other.


## Work within the constraints of existing assumptions

A technique for reducing technical debt when adding a new feature is to work within the constraints of existing assumptions, rather than adding new ones. I'll give an example of how we did this in Doorkeeper.

The organiser of an event can send messages to participants. We encouraged organisers to use this to send a reminder to participants. But some organisers never sent a reminder, perhaps because they forgot or were otherwise too busy. On the other hand, other organisers were sending customised reminders, where they provided detailed instructions for the day of the event.

As a new feature, we wanted to make sure participants always got a reminder, and not rely on the organiser to manually send a message.

The most obvious way to add a reminder functionality would be to just automatically send a reminder email to participants the day before the event. This would be easy to implement, but wouldn't have nicely handled the case where the organiser wanted to send last minute instructions. Those organisers could send a message in addition to the reminder, but then participants would get multiple emails about the same thing, leading to a suboptimal experience. To work around this, we could let the organiser customise this reminder.

The need for being able to customise a reminder led us to realise that there really wasn't much difference between a reminder and a message. If we automatically scheduled a message to be sent out at a certain time, the organiser could then customise that message, or even disable it entirely.

At the time, we didn't have the ability to schedule a message to be sent out at a certain time. But letting the organiser schedule messages was also a useful feature more generally. What's more, keeping the reminders to just be messages allowed us to show all the usual reporting we give organisers, like how many people opened and clicked on the message.

By building upon the existing feature, rather than creating an entirely new standalone one, we were able to come up with a solution that both had better user experience, and created less technical debt.

## Recap

So to give a quick recap, as adding more code to a product will slow down development, we should view all code as technical debt. To ensure development doesn't slowly grind to a halt, we need to ensure our code creates more value than debt.

As developers, we should be a champion of our product, defending it from poorly thought out features. I know this can be tough to do, but we can do a lot more good by helping to ensure we create valuable products, rather than just churning out code.

    <content type="html">When screening developers at a startup, you have competing goals. On the one hand, you have limited resources to dedicate to the hiring process, so you want a process that minimizes the work for you and your team. On the other hand, you have a challenging time attracting talented developers, so you don't want to have a process that puts such a burden on prospective candidates as to scare them off. Having a well defined screening process can help move you towards both these goals though. This guide will outline a basic screening process, which you can adapt to your own needs.

## Stages in a screening process

The exact steps in the screening process will vary from company to company, but will consist of roughly the following.

### Tracking applications

Before you even start soliciting applications, set up some system for tracking applications as they move through your pipeline. If you don't have a system in place, its easy to lose track of people, and the last thing you want to do is miss out on a great developer just because you forgot to follow up with them.

Although there are plenty of dedicated application tracking systems, in the beginning you can get away with something home-brewed. If you're already using something like Trello for task management, creating a new board is a quick and dirty way of tracking developer applications.

### Screening applications

An application from a developer, be it via your company's homepage or a job listing point, is the start of the screening process.

The challenge with this stage is that even candidates who make poor applications can turn out to be great developers. Furthermore, as a startup, candidates that don't look good on paper but turn out to have great aptitude for development can be nuggets of gold, as you're less likely to have to compete over them than developers with illustrious career histories.

My recommendation is at this stage to only filter out people who are clearly a waste of time: those with no relevant skills nor a cover letter that is custom tailored to your organization. For anyone you filter out, I still recommend quickly following up with them with a rejection email. It could be as simple as:

*Thanks for your application. Unfortunately it doesn't quite match what we're looking for right now. We'll keep your application on file, and should something match you in the future, we'll be in touch.*

### Phone call with candidate

Should you not outright reject someone in the initial screening of their resume, as a next step, set up a quick (five to ten minute) phone call with the candidate. One useful service for  scheduling these calls is [Calendly](https://calendly.com/).

During the call, you want to answer any questions a candidate has, and make sure your both on the same page for what the position entails. Especially if you have a limited budget, this can also be a good time to bring up the salary range you're offering for the position.

### Coding test

Before going through a more intensive interview, you want to ensure that the candidate can actually code. If the candidate already has public evidence of this, such as an open source project they can point to, you can skip this step. Otherwise, ask candidates to solve a simple programming challenge on their own time.

With this task you're trying to set a minimum bar, so there's no need for something overly complicated. You're aiming for a task that would take a junior developer at most an hour to do. Ideally, it is also something that's relevant to the job itself, so a stripped down version of a problem you've faced works great.

An interesting alternative approach is to [ask candidates to make a pull request on an open source project](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-programmers-in-the-software-engineering-job-interviews-tested-on-skills-similar-to-a-Topcoder-contest-irrespective-of-the-fact-that-the-skills-required-in-the-industry-are-entirely-different/answer/Marc-Trudel-1). This does put more of a burden on potential applicants, but it also has a benefit to them and the open source community as well.

### Technical interview

For candidates who pass the coding test, you'll want to perform a more in depth interview. How best to perform a technical interview is such a broad topic that I'll leave it to another article for now.

### Make decision

After you've screened the candidate, you'll need to decide whether or not to hire them.

## Overall considerations

Besides the steps themselves, you also want to work to make your process overall a good experience for those involved. Even if you don't end up hiring a given candidate, if they have a good experience, they may introduce other developers to the position, or may even end up being a good hire later down the road. On the other hand, if they have a bad experience, they're likely to tell other developers about it, which may dissuade people from applying.

### Quick and keep the candidate informed

Throughout the whole process, you want to minimize both the time you're asking of candidates, and the calendar time itself from initial application to offer. If you drag your feet on things, a candidate can end up accepting another offer before your process even ends, making it a wasted investment on both your and the candidate's part.

Along with this, you want to keep your candidate informed throughout the whole process. When a candidate completes one stage of the process, and doesn't hear anything back, they start to get anxious, and may assume they didn't get the position.

### Seek to minimize bias

It's unavoidable that bias will creep in throughout the screening process. Pattern recognition can help you identify good candidates quickly, but it can also end up prejudicing yourself against others.

Having a well defined hiring process can in and of itself help fight against bias. Be explicit about what the qualities you're looking for in candidates are, and look for how candidates demonstrate those throughout the process.

    <content type="html">A [2005 interview of Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--APdD6vejI) contains some great insight into how to become a successful entrepreneur.

&gt; **Interviewer:** Where are you taking Facebook, you can expand to those other schools that you're not at, and then what?
&gt;
&gt; **Zuckerberg:** There doesn't necessarily have to be more. A lot of people are focused on taking over the world, they're doing the biggest thing, getting the most users, and I think part of making a difference and doing something cool is focusing intensely. There is a level of service we can provide when we were just at Harvard that we can't provide for all of the colleges, and there's a level of service that we can provide when we're a college network that we wouldn't be able to provide if we went to other types of things. I really just want to see everyone focus on college and creating a really cool college directory product that just very relevant for students and has a lot of information that people care about when they're in college.

The moment you try to be the next Zuckerberg, you've already lost. Successful entrepreneurs don't set out to change the world, but start with unambitious projects like Zuckerberg's online directory of university students. Rather than setting out to do something big, start small and focus relentlessly.

    <content type="html">I came to Japan on a working holiday visa in 2006, and [found a job as a Ruby developer](/articles/finding-a-job-as-a-ruby-developer-in-japan) at a Japanese startup. At the time, options for English speaking developers in Japan were few and far between: I could only find two positions that seemed like they could be a match.

Since then, more and more Japanese tech companies have adopted a strategy of hiring international English speaking developers. On TokyoDev's job board, [I'm listing](/) 100+ opportunities. But if you're looking for your first job here, you probably have a lot of questions. This article tries to answer them, covering the following:

- [What are some success stories of developers moving to Japan?](#what-are-some-success-stories-of-developers-moving-to-japan)

## Do I need to speak Japanese to get a developer job?

No, you don't need Japanese to work as a software developer in Japan, but it'll obviously help. I found that [26% of international developers](/insights/2022-developer-survey#language-usage) never use Japanese at their job, and 31% use it rarely, implying the majority of them are working at jobs that don't require any Japanese skills.

On the other hand, I've also found that [lower Japanese ability among international developers correlated with more professional experience](/insights/2022-developer-survey#experience-vs-years-in-japan). This implies that it's easier to get a job earlier in your career here if you speak more Japanese.

I see it as a balancing act: the more technical acumen and experience you possess, the less likely a lack of Japanese will be a barrier to getting a job here.

So that begs the question, if you're determined in getting a job in Japan, are you better off focusing on improving your Japanese abilities or technical ones? I think this is a question with no right answer, as it really depends on what you enjoy and have aptitude for. If you're someone who likes studying languages, Japanese skills could be your ticket to a developer job in Japan. But if you're someone who has a hard time pushing themselves to put in the vast amount of work it requires, maybe focus on your technical skills instead.

Either way though, I'd recommend you do try to pick up some basic Japanese. While it's theoretically possible to live in a city like Tokyo with no Japanese ability, daily life will go much smoother and more enjoyably if you speak it to some degree.

## Can I get a job as a junior developer in Japan?

If you're not already based in Japan, it'll be almost impossible to get a job as a junior developer in Japan. For companies, it's not worth taking the risk of relocating someone only to have to invest in  them once they arrive. Unless you have at least a couple years experience, it's probably worth not even bothering applying while you're overseas.

There is an exception to this though. Some Japanese companies will recruit university students from abroad. They normally only target people who are fluent in Japanese though, through places like the [Boston Career Forum](https://careerforum.net/en/event/bos/), or those attending certain "elite" universities.

If you are in Japan though, not all hope is lost. I managed to land a job here with no professional experience outside a summer internship and only the most basic of Japanese abilities. You can read more about [my own experience](/articles/finding-a-job-as-a-ruby-developer-in-japan), but I think the biggest reason why I was able to do so was because I was already in the country on a working holiday visa, making it little risk for the company to try me out.

Beyond raw years of experience, signals that you are an exceptional developer are as if not more important. Unless you've worked at a prestigious and recognizable international company like Google, employers aren't likely to be interested in you unless you can demonstrate your abilities. So working on [marketing yourself as a software developer](/articles/public-profile) is something that will not only help you land a job in Japan, but anywhere.

## What's a typical software developer salary in Japan?

As of November 2022, [the median salary for an international developer in Japan](/articles/software-developer-salaries-in-japan) was ¥9.5 million, up ¥1 million from the previous year. A junior developer can expect to make ¥4-6 million, a mid-level developer ¥6-10 million, and a senior developer ¥10-13 million.

While salaries like these might not seem much by silicon valley standards, they're among the top that a person working in Japan can expect to make. The [average salary in Tokyo](https://wagaya-japan.com/en/journal_detail.php?id=5866) is ¥6.2 million, but that's for someone with an average of about 20 years working experience. What's more, 42% of international developers earned ¥10 million or over even though [a 2018 report](https://www.nta.go.jp/publication/statistics/kokuzeicho/minkan2018/pdf/001.pdf) found that only 5% of salaried workers did.

Relatively cheap living costs mean that salary can go far, especially if you're living like a local.  For instance, when I was a single living in Tokyo, I spent about ¥3 million per year, and though I didn't live extravagantly, it didn't feel like I was skimping either. The main concession, at least by North American standards, was living in a relatively small apartment. Still, having the option of being able to pay ¥80,000 per month for a one-room apartment in good shape in a central area is something many other metropolises don't offer.

## How easy is it to get a visa to work as a developer in Japan?

Compared to other countries, Japan is a relatively easy place to get a visa to work as a software engineer. There's no hard caps on the number of visas issued, and if you find a company that wants to hire you, there is little cost or burden placed on the company to get the visa itself.

If you have a university degree in a subject like computer science or software engineering, you are basically guaranteed to be able to obtain a visa. If you don't have such a degree, it still may be possible for you to qualify, but it gets a bit more complicated. Japanese companies won't necessarily know what visa you're eligible for, so it's up to you to educate yourself about the options. A good place to start researching this topic is my guide to [visas for software engineers in Japan](/articles/japanese-engineering-visa-options).

## Will I need to work overtime if I work for a Japanese company?

Japan has a reputation for a working culture that involves working lots of overtime. However, it's certainly possible to find opportunities that involve little to no overtime. When I worked for a Japanese startup, I never worked any overtime, and when I did contracting work for other Japanese development companies, they didn't work overtime either.

More generally, I found that [74% of respondents](/insights/2022-developer-survey#hours-per-week) to my developer survey worked 40 hours or less in a typical week, indicating that my personal experience wasn't such an uncommon one.

## Should I use a Japanese or English resume when applying for a developer job in Japan?

A good rule of thumb is that if a position has an English job description, they're expecting to receive English resumes. If it is a Japanese job description, Japanese.

I would avoid sending a Japanese resume in response to an English job description, as the person reviewing your resume might not speak Japanese (e.g. it could be another international developer who is reviewing it, and I've even seen internal recruiters at some of the bigger tech companies here who don't speak Japanese).

For more on this topic, see our article on [how to write resumes for jobs in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/how-to-write-resumes-for-jobs-in-japan).

## I'm not in Japan yet, what's my first step to a developer job?

The more attractive to an employer you are, the less risk you’ll need to take to get here. If the prospect of coming here, living here for a year, and not finding a job doesn’t bother you, there are plenty of options for you. On the other hand, if you need a job offer before relocating here, your options are more limited.

### Receiving a job offer while overseas

The holy grail. More overseas software developers want to work in tech in Japan than there are companies willing to hire them. Because of this, and the extra risk associated with hiring someone and relocating them to another country, companies are only willing to hire people who are provenly exceptional developers, and aren’t looking for people who can grow into great ones.

Specifically, you’re only likely to get a job offer while overseas if you have extensive experience with technology relevant to the position, or if you can signal you are an exceptional developer. One signal is working at a company famous for their developers, say Google or GitHub. Another is having significant open source contributions. Having presented at a conference is another. Basically, the company needs to think you’re going to be an exceptional addition to their team to get an offer while overseas.

Even if you are a talented software engineer, you’re going to need to work harder to get an offer than you would in your own country. So I’d treat applying for a job here like you would as a junior developer, and be sure that your application demonstrates why you’d be the perfect person for the job, rather than sending them something generic and leaving it to the company to work out why they should hire you.

One thing that will increase your odds of landing a job from abroad is being able to demonstrate a strong connection to the country. Having a Japanese spouse helps, as it indicates to the company you’ll have someone to support your transition to life here, and makes it less likely you’ll get overwhelmed by life here and flake out. Any past experience living here, such as an exchange student, is also a big plus, as it demonstrates you have a more realistic picture of life here. On the other hand, if you’ve never even visited Japan, it will reduce the willingness of companies to hire you.

While opportunities like this are few, I run a small job board for [software developer jobs in Japan](/jobs) that welcome overseas candidates, so this is a good place to start looking for opportunities.

### Working Holiday Visa

I first came to Japan as a software developer on this visa. If you’re eligible for it, this visa gives you the best chances of landing your first job as a software engineer here. Only some countries countries participate it (as of writing this article, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Korea, France, Germany, The United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Norway, Portugal, and Poland) and you need meet the conditions which vary from country to country (typically that you’re under 30 years of age).

The great thing about this visa is that it doesn’t require a sponsoring company, and allows you to do basically any kind of work on it. The concept of the programme is to provide you a way to support yourself during a holiday to Japan, but there are no strict limits about how much you work, and you can get a full time job with it.

From a potential employer’s perspective, having this visa takes away the risk associated with an overseas hire. You’re already here in Japan, so they can just put you through their normal screening process. You’ve demonstrated you are committed enough to living here to take the leap on your own. Furthermore, should the company choose to hire you, you’re allowed to start working full time, without needing to change your visa.

One thing to keep in mind is that you’re only allowed to do a working holiday once in your life in a given country, so timing is important. I think there are two optimal times to take one: when you’ve just graduated from university and after you have a couple years working experience.

I came to Japan just after graduation. My thinking was if I didn’t end up getting a job here, it wouldn’t be a big deal to my future career, as it is fairly common in Canada to take some time off between graduation and your first job. I was lucky enough to land a job as a junior developer here. The combination of having a working holiday visa, having a natural aptitude for programming, and being able to convey to the company that I really wanted to work with them got me the job. If you’re someone who excelled at programming during University, and are willing to put in sustained effort to find a job here, you’ll probably be able to find one too.

The other option is to wait until you have some working experience. It will be much easier for you to get a job locally than in Japan, so if you aren’t so confident about your technical abilities, this could be the way to go. Most positions hiring international developers are looking for people who are already experienced, so if you’re battle-tested, it can boost your odds of getting a job here.

Should you go down the working holiday route, I’d approach it as the visa intends: as a one-year holiday. That way you’re prepared for the possibility you won’t manage to find something, and landing a programmer job becomes a bonus.

### Teaching English

Teaching languages, especially English, is a relatively easy way to get an overseas job offer in Japan, and I know some developers who started their life in Japan this way. Though this is an area I don’t have so much experience with myself, if you’re someone without any teaching qualifications, there are two main paths: the JET Programme and teaching at a conversation school.

The JET Programme is a Japanese governmental programme that brings university graduates to Japan with the aim of providing exposure to international people to Japanese citizens, primarily school students. Most of the positions in the program are teaching related, though if you have strong Japanese skills, there are also some bureaucratic positions available.

Although you can have some influence of where you’ll be placed, you’re most likely to get a position in a small rural town, rather than a metropolis like Tokyo. This means you’ll likely make few job related connections while on the programme unless you really go out of your way to do so. The flip side is that it is a great opportunity to improve your Japanese abilities, as there won’t be many fluent English speakers around you, and you have a relatively large amount of time to use at your discretion, where you can work on bolstering your Japanese or technical abilities.

One restriction of the programme is that you agree to a one year contract, so you are making a commitment when you enter it. Because of the fixed recruiting cycle of the programme, should you drop out, there won’t be any replacement for you, so unless you’re serious about completing the full contract don’t join the programme.

I do know Japanese who through their interaction with teachers in this program became interested in English and life outside of Japan, so I think participating it is doing a service to Japan. Because it is a government run programme, I have a hunch you’ll also get a bit more respect from potential employers over a conversation school job. Had I not had a working holiday visa, the JET programme would have been attractive to me personally.

The other option is teaching a conversation school. While enjoyable to some people, others find it soul crushing. The quality of schools varies quite a bit too, ranging from caring about teaching to practically being scams. The advantage over the JET programme is there are more opportunities available, and you have a decent chance in finding a job in a place like Tokyo, where it is much easier to get into the developer community. Also, because these schools are businesses, and teachers frequently change, should a developer job opportunity come up, you’ll be able to take it.

While teaching at a conversation school for a year or two probably won’t affect your career much, any longer and it will put a blight on your resume. So if you go down this route, I’d put a deadline on yourself to transition out of teaching, or return to your country.

### Attending Japanese language school

If you’re wanting to live in Japan long term, you’ll want to improve your Japanese skills anyways, so attending a Japanese language school is one option that lets you live in Japan and get into the local developer community.

While on a student visa, you can work part time, which theoretically would let you do some work as a developer. Because you also need to be attending school full time, finding employment might be a bit challenging, as you’d need to convince a company to be flexible on working hours,at least until you get a working visa.

If you do decide to enter a Japanese language school, I’d count on spending at least a year at it. This means you already need to have enough money saved up to both cover costs of tuition and your living expenses.

### Attending a Japanese University

I know a number of developers who have came to Japan initially as a graduate student and then found a job. Japanese employers do place a lot of value on the name of the university you attend, so I’d aim for a top tier one.

Postgrad studies is a better way than doing an undergraduate degree in Japan. Generally speaking, the quality of undergraduate education in Japan is pretty low, with most students not taking it seriously. On the other hand, interesting research does happen at the graduate level. Furthermore, while an undergraduate degree at a top tier school would require you to do it in Japanese, at the graduate level you can get by with English (though don’t be surprised if some of your classes turn out to be in Japanese).

While a Japanese university does have the potential to provide connections, your best bet is still to find something yourself. So in addition to your studies, make use of your time to build up connections to the local development community.

Since you have a student visa, you’ll also be able to work part time. As a university student, you’re also more likely than someone just studying Japanese to be able to obtain a software-development related internship.

There are a number of scholarships available for international students studying in Japan. If you manage to obtain one of them, while you might not be able to save money, you at least shouldn’t be losing it.

### Participating in an internship program

While it can be challenging to get [an internship as a developer in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/working-as-a-software-engineer-intern-in-tokyo), if you are a university student, there are some options available to you.  [Vulcanus in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/my-experience-with-vulcanus-in-japan) provides EU engineering students an opportunity to study Japanese in Japan and do an internship with a Japanese company. Another similar program is [The Canada-Japan Co-op Program](https://thecoopjapanprogram.com).

### Give a presentation at a developer event

Knowing what I do now about getting hired, a strategy I would use is giving a technical talk at a Japanese conference (or even more casual event like these [tech events in Tokyo](/articles/tech-meetups-in-tokyo)). Doing a presentation is one of the most effective ways you can demonstrate your skills as a developer, and you’ll be able to meet many potential employers or colleagues in one fell swoop.

Most of the major programming languages have annual conferences where anyone can apply to be a speaker. The ones that come to the top of my head are [Ruby Kaigi](http://rubykaigi.org/), [PHPcon Japan](http://phpcon.php.gr.jp/), [PyCon JP](https://pycon.jp), [Scala Matsuri](http://scalamatsuri.org), and [Node Gakuen](http://nodefest.jp/). If you get selected to speak at one of these conferences, you’ll be able to reach many of Japan’s top developers, and should be able to turn your presentation into getting multiple interview offers.

In addition to these major conferences, there are countless technical events that happen in Tokyo. While they don’t necessarily have as big an audience, most organisers have a tough time finding presenters, so you’re almost guaranteed to have the opportunity to do a presentation. This is a great option if you happen to visiting Japan on holiday. If you’re passing through and would like to present at an event, send me an email, and I’ll help you figure out what your options are.

## What are some success stories of developers moving to Japan?

If you're considering making the move to being a software developer in Japan, you might want to be hearing the stories of others. TokyoDev has a collection of [stories from international developers in Japan](https://www.tokyodev.com/interviews).

Additionally, our community has contributed articles specifically about people of diverse backgrounds, including [women](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/working-as-a-female-software-developer-in-japan), [Indonesians](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/working-as-an-indonesian-software-engineer-in-japan), and [Filipinos](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/filipino-software-developers-in-japan).

    <content type="html">As a developer, I've learned that no matter how good a product I build is, for the product to succeed, it also takes good marketing. The same is true for you as a developer in the job market: while solid technical skills are necessary to land great jobs, your ability to sell yourself is as important, if not more so. Despite this, most developers don't invest in marketing themselves. This means that even a little investment can go a long way in helping you stand out from other developers.

When it comes to applying for a job, the last thing you want to be is a resume in a hiring pipeline. Companies hate screening candidates, and so they're looking for a reason to skip you and move on to the next candidate. Because the hiring process for developers is seen as arduous, companies look for ways to shorten it. One way is focusing on candidates with some sort of public profile, something like open source contributions, a blog, or presentations at developer events, as companies see these developers as being more likely to be talented. This means when you have a public profile and apply for a job, you're far more likely to pass the initial screening and get an interview.

Not only does a strong public profile help you secure jobs you're interested in, it also helps interesting opportunities come to you. As an example, a company I was helping was looking for an internationally-minded Japanese developer with experience using the Ruby on Rails e-commerce plugin Spree. I came across the GitHub profile of a Japanese developer who had contributed to a Spree plugin, and on his personal website wrote that he had recently left his job and was going to spend the next couple of months studying English. I reached out to him and made the introduction to the company, after which they ended up hiring him. While I'm sure there were many other developers out there who would have matched what the company was looking for, he ended up getting the job because he publicly talked about his experience and goals.

So if you're a developer who doesn't have any public profile yet, how can you get started? In this article, I'll present the different ways I've come across for increasing your public profile as a developer.

## Contribute to open source

One of the strongest positive signals you can send to a prospective employer is having open source contributions, ideally ones related to the technologies the company is using.

The best way to contribute to open source is to do it on the job. When you're developing using an open source library and come across a problem, be it a bug or missing feature, there are two approaches of dealing with it: work around the issue in your application or fix the library itself. Whenever possible, opt to fix it in the library itself. Even if fixing the root problem seems like it will take longer than coming up with a quick workaround, fixing the issue in the library itself will prevent regressions in the future when the library is upgraded and your quick fix breaks. So this way everyone wins: you get an open source contributing, the community gets better software, and your company saves time in the long run.

Similarly, if you're looking for a proactive way of increasing your contributions, try upgrading the libraries your application uses to a beta version or recently released major version. When using a beta version, it's more likely things will break, often in a way that is trivial to fix. For instance, I got [eight commits to Ruby on Rails accepted](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/paul-mcmahon/commits) when I upgraded our application to Rails 3.2 soon after it was released.

Besides making the contributions themselves, you also need to make them visible. Unless you're an open source superstar, GitHub doesn't do a very good job of this, hiding historical contributions or ones made under an organisation. So I'd suggest listing your contributions somewhere.

## Participate in events

The great thing about offline events is serendipity: you have the opportunity to meet interesting people that you'd never go looking for otherwise. Being a regular attendee at developer events is a good way to make connections to the local community, and even if you're a fairly passive participant, eventually opportunities will come to you.

However, rather than waiting for opportunities to come to you, look for ways to make them come to you. One good way is to speak at a local developer event. As an event organiser myself, one of my challenges is to get people to present at my event, so I'm very happy whenever someone wants to give a talk. Don't be intimidated and think you need to be an expert on a topic to present on it. If there's something you're interested in, chances are you'll be able to give a good presentation about it. Talk to the organiser of the event about what kind of presentation you want to give, and they'll help you figure out how to make something work.

As an introverted person, giving a presentation also makes participating in an event more rewarding. Rather than having to look for ways to make conversation with other participants, they'll come to you wanting to discuss a topic you're already interested in (whatever you presented about). Not only does it make things easier at that event, but people will remember you at future ones.

## Write articles

The first articles I wrote for Tokyo Dev were [event reports](/blog/categories/event-report) where I talked about my experience at several developer related events. While articles about events are ephemeral and don't have so much value in and of themselves, these articles did result in me being contacted by a developer interested in getting a job in Japan, and prompted me to write [Finding A Job as a Ruby Developer in Japan](/articles/finding-a-job-as-a-ruby-developer-in-japan), which is now one of the top results for searches like "Japan developer jobs", and has led me to write many more articles on the topic. So when you're first starting out, don't worry too much about what you write about, as anything is better than nothing.


## Create a personal website hosted on a custom domain

Having a personal website provides you with a single place to consolidate your online identity. In the beginning, this can be as simple as a single page with links to your other online profiles. As time goes on, you can flesh it out with articles you write, links to talks you give, or open source projects you contribute to.

When setting it up, I'd purchase your own domain name, over than using a free subdomain at some service. Being in control of your domain allows you to migrate from one web platform to another. Additionally, you can send email from your own domain, which I've found to be a positive signal over a generic one like hotmail or gmail.

    <content type="html">When you're advertising a developer position online, a job posting is often the first time a developer hears about your company. Despite the posting being the first step in the hiring flow, companies put little effort into them, often having it be little more than a list of requirements for the candidate. This kind of poor job posting will stop talented developers from applying to your company. By improving your job posting, you’ll get more and better applicants. I’ve helped a dozen or so companies with writing job postings for developers, and want to share my tips for creating a good posting.

#### Communicate the culture of your development team

Talented developers tend to make the assumption that any given company is a boring place to work with a poor work environment. By describing the culture of your development team, you can set yourself apart from other companies.

A good place to start is by asking your existing team to describe what it is like being a developer there. What do they enjoy about working there? What values do they have? How do they develop software? Based on their answers, write up a couple paragraphs describing the development culture.

If your company has open source contributions, be sure to mention that it values open source and link to the contributions (such as your company's GitHub organisation page). Seeing that a company has contributed something meaningful to the community (i.e., not just a wrapper for their APIs), sends a good signal that it has a healthy environment for developers.

#### Avoid requiring experience with specific technologies

Besides culture, talking about the technology you are using can be a good way of connecting with candidates who have used the same technology in the past, or want to try it out. I’d steer away from putting requirements with experience in a specific candidate unless it is absolutely necessary, as a good developer can become proficient with new technology in days, and outperform experienced but poor ones in months.

Furthermore, I’ve noticed that good developers tend to underestimate their skills, and I’ve seen ones that almost but don’t quite meet the listed requirements avoid applying, despite them being a great match for the position. Rather than letting the candidates talk themselves out of applying, you’re in a better position if you let anyone who is interested in applying do so, and then work on improving your screening process to quickly weed out the bad matches.

The only case where I’d explicitly look to hire a developer experienced in a specific technology is when you are hiring for a new technical skill set that your team doesn’t already have. For instance, if you are looking to develop your first iOS application in house, and are wanting to hire someone to develop it, requiring experience is perfectly reasonable. In the job posting though, I’d make it clear that this will be your first iOS hire, and that’s why you’re looking for someone experienced. Furthermore, rather than putting in a requirement such as "three years experience iOS development", use something achievement based instead. “Have your own app on the iOS store” is a much more meaningful requirement, and will help you filter out poor candidates better than the years of experience requirement, while not discouraging quick learners from applying.

#### Clarify your position on remote work

Another thing that can be worthwhile putting in the posting is whether you allow employees to work remotely or not. I’d only put this in if you have a firm stance on this, be it your company is already set up to accommodate remote developers, or your company requires them to be onsite (if so explain why). If you’re company doesn’t have a strong opinion on it, I’d not mention anything about it though.

#### Don't list generic benefits

After you’ve covered culture and technology, I’d include benefits, but only if your company offers something exceptional. So don’t bother listing stuff like health insurance or paid holidays, as it is the expectation that you’ll offer them. I’d exclude minor benefits like catered meals or on site gym as well. These kind of perks can be great when your employees talk to other developers about how great they are, but as a bullet item in a job posting they don’t do anything to convince someone who would not otherwise apply to do so. The absence of a benefits section leaves a better impression than one with poor or average benefits, so don’t be afraid to not have one at all.

#### Help applicants make their application shine

Give candidates detailed instructions on how to apply for the position. Describe to them what your ideal application would look like, rather than hoping they send you what you want to see. Developers are terrible at applying for jobs and by giving them instructions on how to do so, you help avoid biasing yourself against those who are good candidates but poor at applying. I think [Stripe’s questions](https://stripe.com/jobs/positions/engineer/#engineering) are a good starting point:

&gt; **You should include these in your application:**
&gt;
&gt; * A writeup explaining who you are as a programmer. Sample questions you might want to address: What projects have you enjoyed working on? Which have you disliked? What motivates you? What surprising things have you learned about yourself since starting to program?
&gt; * A piece of code that does something you find interesting, and an explanation of why. (It doesn't have to be your own code.)
&gt; * Links to online profiles you use (GitHub, Twitter, etc).
&gt; * A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).
&gt;
&gt; If there are teams you'd be particularly interested in working on, please let us know (and tell us why!). This way we can have you interview with the people you'll likely work best with. This won't bind you to a specific team—we can figure that out together as the we learn more about your interests and strengths.

What I like about Stripe’s questions is that they reflect what is important to them when making a hiring decision. They are also open ended with no clear right answer, so they help candidates get their personality accross.

#### Describe your hiring process

As a final section, included what your hiring process looks like. Having a clear process in place demonstrates to candidates that you’re taking them seriously, and that their applications won’t go into a black hole. One of the best examples of this (and job postings in general) is [nccgroup’s security consultant jobs page](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/careers/security-consulting-careers/):

&gt; We like our recruiting process to be transparent to our candidates. It roughly consists of the following steps:
&gt;
&gt; 1. **An initial call between you and a member of our team.** We’ll tell you more about the company, the work that we do, a day in the life of one of our consultants, and why we think NCC Group is a great place to work. Our pitch, basically. You’ll surely have some questions for us. Ask away! We will also have some basic technical questions on this call, but they are more for scoping your experience, rather than to determine if you move forward. You will move forward past this point.
&gt; 2. **1-2-1 technical phone interviews.** We’ll connect you with members of our team for more in-depth technical conversations to see what you know and how your mind works.
&gt; 3. **Practical Challenges.** We have several at our disposal that we can use to gauge practical abilities in areas like web application, network security, and protocol analysis. Most candidates will complete both the web and protocol challenges. These challenges aren’t meant to be imposing. We will arm you with resources allowing you to prepare adequately to be successful.
&gt; 4. **In-person interviews.** We now have a good sense of your skillset. If it seems like a good fit, we’ll bring you in to meet with the team in your preferred region for some final interviews.
&gt; 5. **The offer.** If you made it this far, hopefully we’ve hired you!

After reading it, I’m left with the impression that they’ve thought a lot about the hiring process, making me enthusiastic to work with them as they clearly value hiring the right people (so their existing team is probably great).

    <title>Hiring a Japanese Virtual Assistant</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/hiring-virtual-assistant-japan"/>

    <content type="html">As someone [running a small business in Japan](/articles/creating-company-japan), I've hired several Japanese virtual assistants to help me with various small tasks. Especially if you're not a fluent Japanese speaker, knowing where to look for one can be tricky, so I'll share my tips for finding one.

## Decide who you're looking for

The first thing to do is figure out what you need help with. For myself, the primary thing I was looking for was someone who could do first level Japanese customer support for [Doorkeeper](https://www.doorkeeper.jp/). I had been doing it myself, which had mixed results. On the one hand, some customers were glad they could talk directly to the founder. On the other, my Japanese ability leaves a lot to be desired, so composing responses was time consuming and they weren't even in proper Japanese (to the point sometimes people replied to my emails in English).

The person I was looking for obviously had to be a native Japanese speaker. I also wanted someone who could be regularly available, as opposed to in short bursts, so that replies went out to customers quickly. English comprehension was also important, as I'm much faster and accurate when communicating in English. Finally, I wanted someone who could work largely independently with minimal instructions, and so I thought a single individual that would get familiar with the product and the processes over time would be better suited then a team.

## Finding Japanese virtual assistants

Once you have an idea of what kind of person you're looking for, there are a number of different services that can help you find someone.

### Japanese virtual assistants agencies

Rather than directly hiring someone yourself, there's a number of companies that offer Japanese virtual assistants. The main advantages of going with a company are that they handle the screening of assistants and can also ensure continuity so that you don't need to deal with things like your assistant taking time off or quitting.

#### Virtual Assist Japan

[Virtual Assist Japan](https://virtualassist-japan.com/) provides dedicated bilingual virtual assistants on a monthly basis. Their lowest tier plan is ¥7,500 per month for 3 hours of tasks, however it is restricted to those personal in nature. For business tasks, prices start at ¥12,000 per month for 3 hours of tasks. They also offer a 1 hour free trial so you can evaluate their service. The service was established by Nagisa Uchiyama in 2017, who runs the company with a small team of assistants.

#### MailMate

MailMate has offered bilingual personal virtual assistants [in the past](https://mailmate.jp/assistant). It isn't clear to me if this part of their service is still active, or if they're focused exclusively on receiving and scanning mail.

### Freelancing Platforms

Freelancing platforms are services that make it easy to find and pay individuals to perform specific tasks. They're not limited to virtual assistants, though this is usually one of their major categories.

### International Freelancing Platforms

There's a number of freelancing platforms that make it easy to hire individuals on a task basis. The most popular of these is probably [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/). While these can be a great way to find an English speaking virtual assistant, finding a native level Japanese speaking one is much more challenging. Searching for virtual assistants in Japan only yields 18 results, of which based on their name, only 12 appear to be native Japanese, and only 9 of those have earned over $1K through the platform (which is an indicator that they're active to me). These freelancers charge between $6.25 and $45 per hour, with a median of $25 per hour.

### Domestic Freelancing Platforms

There are several freelancing platforms targetting the Japanese domestic market, including [Crowdworks](https://crowdworks.jp), [Lancers](http://www.lancers.jp/), and [Shufti](http://www.shufti.jp/). The platforms themselves aren't as mature as their international counterparts, but they do have lots of Japanese talent on them. All the domestic services only have Japanese user interfaces, so to use them, you'll need to at least have enough Japanese skills to navigate their user interface. However, I'd suggest making the job posting itself in English, as it will help you stand out among all the other postings and will attract bilingual candidates.

In 2014, I tried posting a job on Crowdworks, and had about 20 replies to my posting within a day, several of which were good candidates. The person who I ended up hiring through it is still with me six years later in 2020, so it worked out well for me. I initially paid her by time, at a rate of about ¥2,500 per hour. However, I ended up switching to a monthly retainer agreement where I'd paid her a set monthly fee for up to a couple of hours of work per day. This provided her more stability, and guaranteed me a certain amount of availability.

### Gengo

[Gengo](http://www.gengo.com/) is not a virtual assistant service, but rather a translation platform. With it, you post translation jobs, and from their pool of screened translators, someone will complete it. There is no selection process, so you can view the service like artificial machine translation: put text in, a translation comes out (sometimes the translator will ask you questions though).

I tried them a couple of times, but found because translating a web application requires a high amount of context, we didn't have such great results. Because Gengo pays the translator per word, I don't think the incentives are aligned properly for something like translating a two word button, where a couple of paragraphs of text are required to describe the context.

On the other hand, if you have lots of content that can stand on its own, such as a product catalogue for an online shop, they could be a great option.

## Evaluating a Candidate

Once you've found someone you want to work with, you need to evaluate them. In our case, we had most success with giving several promising candidates the same task. For instance, in our case, I sent a sample customer inquiry, gave some notes about what I thought should be included in the reply, and asked the candidate to draft a sample reply.

If a candidate didn't understand what you wanted them to do, disqualify them immediately, as likely their English abilities aren't good enough. Asking questions to clarify something is fine, but the candidate should be able to at least get the gist of what you want.

If you're having the assistant do something like translation or customer support, you'll also want to evaluate their Japanese skills. I've found that even if someone is a native Japanese speaker, if they haven't had previous customer support experience, they likely won't use the standard phrases used when replying to a customer (and Japanese culture values doing things in the standard way).

As a non-native speaker, it is basically impossible for me to evaluate someone's Japanese. I got around this by showing sample responses to several Japanese friends, and asking them which was best. Their feedback turned out to be invaluable, because the person I was initially leaning towards happened to be almost a native level English speaker, but didn't use the proper customer support expressions. Instead, I went with my second choice, who came up with a more natural reply, and has since turned out to be great.

    <title>Recruiting Developers Through Conferences</title>

    <content type="html">Conferences bring together passionate developers, typically around a specific technology such as a programming language like Ruby. This makes them the perfect place to recruit developers for your company. This article outlines how a company can get the most value out of these conferences.

## Don’t send recruiters to conferences
Developer conferences are organized by the community. Respect this and don’t treat the conference as only a venue to find new talent, or else your attempts to find developers will backfire.

Don’t send any HR types who have no interest in programming to a conference. Only employees who enjoy the content of the conference itself should attend.

## Sponsor conferences
Sponsoring a conference is a low hanging fruit. It has almost no overhead for a company: write a check, supply some information, and you’re done. Developers value companies who contribute back to the community through sponsorship, and doing so is an easy way to increase awareness of your brand in the developer community.

However, sponsorship alone is unlikely to give you many leads for developer candidates. Instead, a more proactive approach is needed.

## Lower barriers for your developers to attend conferences
Your existing development team is your best tool to recruit new developers, so make it as easy as possible for them to attend conferences.

One simple step is to treat attending a conference as a normal workday. The last thing you want is to have your developers take time off to attend a conference they are interested in, as it not only discourages attendance, but also reflects badly on your company when other developers hear about it.

Along similar lines, you should also cover any costs associated with attending an event, such as the admission fee. Developer conferences are typically not for profit events, and as such offer an extraordinarily high return on investment when compared to other professional training events.

## Encourage employees to present at conferences
Having a developer present at a conference is great exposure for your company. Talented developers want to work with other passionate developers, so when an employee presents at a conference, it reflects positively on your brand in the developer community.

Preparing a presentation is quite time consuming. For myself, it takes at least forty hours of preparation for a thirty minute presentation. Allow employees to prepare their presentation during normal work hours to encourage them to present at conferences.

    <title>Adoption of Ruby by Japanese Businesses</title>

    <content type="html">The first Ruby related event I attended in Japan was [Ruby Kaigi 2007](http://jp.rubyist.net/RubyKaigi2007/). At the conference, from talking to other developers, I was surprised to learn that despite them being passionate about Ruby, they weren't using Ruby at their day job. Since then, things have changed, and today most Ruby developers I talk to at events are using Ruby professionally as well.

When I was looking over [this year's Ruby Kaigi sponsor list](http://rubykaigi.org/2014/sponsors), I noticed the sponsors were quite different from that of my first Ruby Kaigi. Seeing this, I realized the sponsors were a good proxy for Ruby usage by businesses in Japan, and I created some graphs of the sponsors.

First, to get an overall picture on Ruby adoption, I graphed the number of sponsors.

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center"&gt;Number of Sponsors&lt;/h4&gt; ![Graph](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTQ5NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e23af73611755f133fc34cf4589899d86bf68731/sponsor-numbers.png)

Over the years, Ruby Kaigi sponsors have steadily grown.

At first glance, [Ruby Kaigi 2011](http://rubykaigi.org/2011) appears to have less sponsors than the previous year, but this was because they had 128 "Individual Sponsors", which I didn't count. This was the only year Ruby Kaigi had this kind of sponsorship.

There is no data for 2012, as Ruby Kaigi went on hiatus as the organizers established a non-profit organization to manage the finances of Ruby Kaigi.

The more interesting thing I graphed was the kind of companies which sponsored Ruby Kaigi.

&lt;h4 style="text-align: center"&gt;Ruby Kaigi Sponsors by Business Type&lt;/h4&gt; ![Graph](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTQ5NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fd7c9e316fb60974e8c504a3adb59c1116310dd8/sponsor-type.png)

I classified the companies as *Product* if the primary focus of the business was a software product like a web application, *Outsource* if their focus was developing custom solutions for clients, and *Enterprise* if they were megacorps like Microsoft.

This graph shows there are three pretty distinct phases in the kind of companies that sponsored Ruby Kaigi.

## Phase 1: Ruby isn't mainstream

At Ruby Kaigi 2006 and 2007, the sponsors are a pretty random group of companies. We have the two companies that have sponsored **every** Ruby Kaigi: [NaCl](http://www.netlab.jp/) (the company Matz was working for) and [Eiwa Systems Management](http://www.esm.co.jp/english.html) (where many of the key figures involved in organizing Ruby Kaigi work). Both of these are outsourcing companies.

Then you have an assortment of companies like IBM, Comodo, and Nifty, who had a big budget and a tenuous connection to Ruby at best.

Some other big companies like Sun, Rakuten, and Cybozu where Ruby was used in their research divisions, but wasn't part of their main business also sponsored it.

## Phase 2: Building stuff for others using Ruby

In December 2007, Ruby on Rails 2.0 was released, and the idea that Ruby was a great for building web services was catching on. Japan had almost no startup ecosystem, and almost all development was outsourced.

With this, we saw a huge uptake in the number of outsourcing companies sponsoring Ruby Kaigi from 2008, with almost 70% of the sponsors being outsourcers in 2009.

The main motivation of these companies to sponsor Ruby Kaigi was to drum up leads for themselves.

Over the next couple years, the outsourcing companies started to give way to product companies, but in 2011, half the sponsors were still outsourcers.

## Phase 3: Startup Boom

When Ruby Kaigi was reborn in 2013, product companies took over, representing about 60% of the sponsors. Some of them were established companies like Pixiv (launched 2007) and Cookpad (launched 1997), who had services that had grown over the years, but their were also some new upstarts like Qiita (launched 2011) and [Treasure Data](/companies/treasure-data) (founded 2011).

These companies are sponsoring Ruby Kaigi to recruit developers to work for them (using Ruby). It seems now is a better time than ever to get a [Ruby jobs in Japan](/jobs/ruby).

    <content type="html">BitCoin has gotten a ton of buzz, so when I came across [a graph of the number of bitcoin transactions per day](https://blockchain.info/en/charts/n-transactions), I was flabbergasted: **there are only about 60,000 transactions per day.** I graphed the number relative to [the number of tweets about bitcoin](http://topsy.com/analytics?q1=paypal) per day below. ![Graph](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTQ5NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c7e6a9f7a4984a4447cc70c01d9f8ae7ff33c2e3/bitcoin-hype.png)

So there is one tweet about Bitcoin for every three transactions!

Furthermore, this is only the number of transactions, and not the number of times wealth is exchanged between individuals. I suspect a majority of them are transactions of individuals [moving bitcoins between wallets](https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works), using [mixing services](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mixing_service), and so on.

Even if a large percentage of these transactions were to represent real transfers of wealth, it is still pitifully low. In the US alone, there are about 70 million credit card transactions per day ([26.2 billion in 2012](http://www.frbservices.org/files/communications/pdf/research/2013_payments_study_summary.pdf)).

For BitCoin to be money, people need to be spending it. But it doesn't seem like that is the case.

    <content type="html">At [Oedo Ruby Kaigi 04](http://regional.rubykaigi.org/oedo04/), [Leonard Chin](https://twitter.com/lchin) gave a presentation entitled "How to Survive and Thrive as an Engineer in a Foreign Land". Although the presentation is for a Japanese audience, it is based on his experience of working in Japan as an Australian, so it's a good talk if you want to [work as a programmer in Japan](/articles/first-job-programmer-japan) as well.

The presentation was in Japanese, so I'll summarize the key points.

## Working abroad is hard

Lot's of Japanese engineers say they want to work abroad, but few actually do, because working in a foreign country is hard. The two biggest hurdles are learning the language and getting a job.

### Learning the language

Although living in Japan will help you learn Japanese, living here alone isn't enough to become a fluent speaker of the language. Similarly, dating a Japanese person can help, but also isn't enough. Another common trap is hanging out with friends who speak your own language; it's better to avoid this if you want to improve at Japanese.

Attending a Japanese language school will help you get the basics of the language, but it is costly, and once you move beyond the basics, has diminishing returns. Taking a Japanese language exam works to help you set a goal, but the exam itself isn't worth anything, and often the content isn't useful Japanese. In the end, there isn't any trick to learning a language, it's just lots and lots of practice.

### Getting a job

A prerequiste of getting a job in a foreign country is that you are already a skilled developer.

For finding a job, sites that target bilingual people, such as [Daijob](http://www.daijob.com/en/) or [GaijinPot](http://www.gaijinpot.com/) have the advantage that employers are explicitly looking for bilingual people. On the other hand, they have only a small job pool, and the companies that do use them tend to be multinational companies, as opposed to local ones.

Local job sites like [リクルート](http://job.rikunabi.com/) or [マイナビ](http://job.mynavi.jp/) have a wide range of positions available at local companies. However, the companies aren't expecting non-Japanese to apply, so you might run in to issues because the companies won't know how to deal with you.

The best way to find a job is the same as anywhere: network with the local community. In his case, he started by attending one of the many [Ruby on Rails events in Japan](http://www.doorkeeperhq.com/events/ruby), [Rails勉強会@東京](http://railsmeetingtokyo.doorkeeper.jp/). From his participation in that event, he found out that [Ruby Kaigi](http://rubykaigi.org) (Japan's largest Ruby conference) was looking for English speakers to help out, so he volunteered. Through his connections to the local Ruby community, he was able to get a great job.

## Thriving as an Engineer

Speaking the language and getting a job is enough to survive as a developer in a foreign country, but not enough to thrive. To thrive, you need to learn the culture, which means answering:

* What does that crazy slang mean?
* What jokes are funny?
* Where does that image / reference come from?
* What do engineers like to talk about?

Fortunately, developers live on the internet, so it is easy to find this culture. Sites like [2ちゃんねる](http://www.2ch.net/), [togetter](http://togetter.com/), [bokete.jp](http://bokete.jp/), and [ニコニコ動画](http://www.nicovideo.jp/) are great places to start. When you encounter a meme on those sites, don't dismiss it as stupid just because it is different; instead, try to enjoy it. When you come across cultural reference you don't get, google it to figure out what it means, and then embrace it as your own.

## The video itself

The video is in Japanese, but the slides are mostly in English, so watching it is a good opportunity to practice listening to Japanese. Also, if you are Japanese and wanting to work outside of Japan, it covers how you can learn western developer culture from reddit (which I don't talk about in this post).

    <title>How to create your own company in Japan</title>

    <content type="html">Since coming to Japan, I've incorporated three companies. Although creating a company isn't a walk in the park, I think it is easier than the general perception is. Part of the problem is the lack of English-language information about it. I hope by sharing my experiences I can help other people get started. This article is aimed at individuals already living in Japan, who want to create their own business, as opposed to companies looking to establish a Japanese subsidiary.

## When do you need a company?

If you're considering creating a company, you probably have something you want to sell, be it your time in the form of services, or a product. However, that doesn't mean you need a company. Japan has the legal concept of [sole proprietorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_proprietorship), under which you and your business are the same entity (though it is possible to use a different name for your business).

For people looking to run a business by themselves, sole proprietorship can be an attractive option. It avoids the overhead of a company, and any income you make goes directly into your own bank account. With a sole proprietorship, you can still hire people, self-sponsor your own visa, and even those of others.

I initially ran TokyoDev as a sole proprietorship. It was a side project making a small amount of income, and so it didn't seem worth the overhead of setting up a company for it. Even as it grew, and I took on some of Japan's biggest companies, I continued as a sole proprietorship. It wasn't until I was making significant revenue that I transitioned it to be a company instead.

### Companies allow assets to exist independently of you

For TokyoDev, a major driver for switching from a company was that I wanted the business to be able to continue independently of me. For example, if I was to sell the business in the future, it would be much easier if all the assets were packaged up in a company, as they could be easily transferred.

I didn't have any concrete plans about this, but [when I sold Doorkeeper](/articles/why-i-sold-doorkeeper), it made me realize that if a business doesn't eventually change hands it will die. Every time I signed a new contract for TokyoDev as an individual, I saw it'd be a little bit more painful to transition to a company in the future, so I decided to pull off the band-aid and do it (for more details, see my article on [converting a Japanese sole proprietorship to a company](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/converting-a-japanese-sole-proprietorship-to-a-company)).

### Companies allow for shared ownership

Another reason for creating a company is if you want to share the ownership with others. This was the primary reason I established my first company, a development consultancy, with two partners. We wanted to be able to take on development consulting gigs as a group, as it would both allow us to do bigger projects, and also help spread the risk over us doing freelancing individually.

### Companies limit liability

With Doorkeeper, an event registration platform I founded, we processed hundreds of millions of yen in payments on behalf of organizers. I would never want to do that as an individual, as if something major went wrong (for instance a hacker gained access to the system), there could be the possibility of huge financial liability. In the case of an individual, the liability I'd have would be unlimited, meaning if something went terribly wrong, it could bankrupt me personally. Companies limit this liability.

### The tax benefits of a company are overstated

Accountants in Japan will often tell you that you should switch from a sole proprietorship to a company if you're making at least ¥8 million per year, as you'll pay less tax. While this may be true in some cases, when TokyoDev was making significantly more than that, I had an accountant simulate my different tax bills if I was to run the business as a sole proprietor versus as a company, and there wasn't an obvious winner. [This article](https://ty-tax-accountant.com/en/archives/6388) is the best explanation of the tax tradeoffs of the two approaches that I've seen.

## So you've decided to create a company, which type do you go with?

There are two types of companies you can create in Japan: Godo-kaisha (GK) and Kabushiki-Kaisha (KK). Wikipedia gives [a good summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gōdō_gaisha) of the differences between the two. I've ran both types of companies, and from a day-to-day perspective I didn't notice any substantial difference. So personally I'd go with the KK by default, as it provides more flexibility.

## How do you get money out of the company?

After you create a company, it will hopefully start creating value, either in revenue from its customers, or something like intellectual property it creates. At some point, you'll want to move some of that wealth from the company to you. Depending on how you do that has some pretty severe tax implications, so it's important to understand the options.

### Paying yourself a salary

As an employee of a company, you're paid a salary: a fixed amount you receive at regular intervals. Directors can also receive a salary, but to ensure it is counted as an expense, you need to fix it within the first three months of your fiscal year.

If your goal is to maximize your personal wealth, then paying salary is one of the most tax efficient ways to move the wealth from the company to you as an individual. By successfully predict what your income will be for a given fiscal year, you can effectively take all the profit for yourself as salary, ensuring the company itself isn't profitable (and thus avoiding corporate income tax).

But especially when you're starting a business, cash flow isn't consistent. When you don't have enough money to pay your salary, you normally record paying yourself the full salary in the books, but instead of giving yourself cash, you'll record it as a debt from the company to you. Later, when the company has enough money, they'll repay you.

So why wouldn't you just set your salary to some amount so high you're guaranteed not to exceed it? Well, firstly directors are only allowed to be compensated a "reasonable amount". More importantly though, even though your company isn't giving you the cash, you still need to pay personal income tax and social insurance, which are based on your salary regardless of this debt. This means if you set your salary too high, you'll end up paying tax on money you never get (maybe there is someway to claim it as a loss, but I've never investigated it).

### Paying yourself a bonus

I've heard you can also declare a fixed bonus with the tax authority within the first three months of your fiscal year, and decide whether or not to pay it in an all or nothing thing at the end of the fiscal year.

### Paying yourself dividends

If your company makes profit, you are allowed to issue dividends to the owners of the company (which will just be you if you don't have any partners or investors). However, profit will be taxed at a rate of about 31%. On top of this, you'll still need to pay income tax (not capital gains) on any dividends. So from a tax perspective, you normally don't want to issue dividends.

### Deducting expenses

Japan seems fairly generous in what you can call company expenses. An accountant will be able to tell you what you can and can't expense, but there are two major ones to consider.

First is your rent. If your company makes a rental contract for your residence, the company can count all the fees associated with making the contract as an expense (e.g. the real estate agent fee, the "key money", etc), and can pay for 50% of your rent as an expense. There are some limits on what kind of accommodation they can provide, but my understanding is that any "normal" rental will be apply.

The other is a company car. As I understand it, as long as you have a reason why you need to sometimes use a car for work, you can purchase it for the company, and use it for personal purposes as well. This isn't something I've investigated myself, but I had one accountant suggest I could buy a *used* Ferrari as a business expense, which I found pretty amusing. It felt like he was saying my business was doing good, but not that good.

### Setting up a retirement allowance

Retirement allowance is a lump sum payment you receive from a company when you leave it. There's certain conditions about the length of stay with a company, but it's one way that's incredibly tax advantaged to get money from the company to you. The biggest tradeoff is that it means your leaving cash in the company for long periods of time, where it likely isn't growing like it would if you invest it as an individual. It is theoretically possible to set up a brokerage account for your company and invest those retirement funds, but my accountant recommended against that as it introduces other complications. So to me, this seems like a good option for moving extra money that happens to be lying about in the company's accounts when you move on from it, but otherwise probably isn't as good as it looks at first glance.

### Selling your company

Depending on the nature of your business, the value you're building up in your company can be more than just the cash coming in. At some point, you may be looking to cash that out as well, like I did with Doorkeeper.

In this case, I already had a buyer lined up who I thought would be a good match. If you don't have this, there are a number of marketplaces such as [Manda](https://manda.bz), [Tranbi](https://www.tranbi.com), and [Batonz](https://batonz.jp), but I don't have any personal experience with these.

The sale of Doorkeeper involved me selling all my shares in the company to a buyer. When I did this, I had to pay capital gains tax of 20.315%, which is substantially lower than what I would have had to pay if I had received it as income instead.

In my case, the sale went as smooth as I could have hoped it would. After the buyer made me an offer, I contacted the law firm [southgate](https://southgate-law.com/en/), who specializes in small-medium scale M&amp;A transactions like mine was. Having them represent me was good for my piece of mind, as I wanted to be careful not to accidentally take on more liabilities with the sale.

## What residency status do you need to create a company in Japan?

Probably the most frequently asked question, and the one that it hardest to answer. Perhaps an easier way of looking at it is with a given residency status, what kind of company can you create (and run).

### Spouse of Japanese National / Permanent Residency

Anything goes. Nothing special to worry about here.

### Business Manager

With this residency status, you are allowed to run any kind of business, and is the most commonly recommended option. The downside of this status are its requirements: a permanent office (not a coworking space or virtual office) and a ¥5,000,000 investment in the company (or employing two Japanese nationals). Anecdotally, I've heard immigration is stricter on this visa than other visa types.

### Startup Visa

With [the startup visa program](https://www.meti.go.jp/english/policy/economy/startup_nbp/startup_visa.html), you can get a visa much like the business manager one, only with less requirements. However, there are certain other conditions, and they are only offered for certain municipalities.

### Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services

If you're already on an Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services visa, you can work as a sole proprietor and [self-sponsor a renewal](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2012/09/04/how-tos/self-sponsored-visas-a-passport-to-freedom-or-a-world-of-pain/). I have first hand experience helping freelancers I've contracted with do this.

It's also my understanding that there is nothing preventing you from incorporating a Japanese company on this visa.

Where things get less clear is what is permitted when you want to work for your own company on this status. If you ask immigration about this, they'll tell you to get the Business Manager visa. And yet, I renewed an engineering visa while I was a partner of a Godo Gaisha (and didn't hide this in my application). This company did have a "managing partner" who was on a spouse visa, so perhaps that was why it was permitted. It was also around 2010, and so perhaps things have changed since then.

## How do you open a corporate bank account?

To do business in Japan, you'll need a Japanese bank account. Unfortunately, since April 2013, it has become a lot harder for a new business to get a bank account - this isn't a problem just for international founders, Japanese have this problem as well. Apparently, Yakuza were getting people in debt to them to create a company, use the company to create a bank account, and then use the bank account for nefarious means. The solution to the problem: make it difficult for new businesses to create bank accounts.

After I had registered Doorkeeper Inc, the first thing I did was go to my local MUFJ (as I already have a bank account there, I thought it would be easiest), and try to open an account. However, they rejected me. Maybe I should have gone to the same branch as my personal account, as I heard that's easier (as apparently they "know" you better). But it was on the other side of town, so I tried a couple of the other major banks, only to be rejected too.

I ended up going with [PayPay Bank](https://www.paypay-bank.co.jp), as they accepted me with a simple online application. They give you an Visa debit card, which works well for company expenses. The main downsides of them are that they don't support automatic bill payments, so you need to manually pay your social insurance every month, and they don't accept SWIFT transfers, only domestic ones.

These downsides weren't a big deal for Doorkeeper, so I ended up never opening another bank account.

When I incorporated TokyoDev, I looked into using [Rakuten Bank](https://www.rakuten-bank.co.jp/business/), as their business accounts do support SWIFT transfers. However, their application form required you to enter a landline phone number, so I gave up, and just used PayPay Bank again.

## Who can help you with running a company in Japan?

You're probably overwhelmed by all of this. But there are people and organizations that can help you.

### Accountants

When you're running a company, an accountant will be the professional you're going to have the closest relationship with. I suggest taking your time to find the right one for you. This is best done before you incorporate, as they can make suggestions for how to structure things, and also make other relevant introductions

With Doorkeeper, I initially looked for a bilingual accountant. However, I found that they typically charged twice (or more) what ones who only spoke Japanese did. So despite not having stellar Japanese abilities, I went with a Japanese speaking one. It seemed to work in the beginning, but whether it was the nature of the product I was offering, or my poor Japanese skills, I felt like the relationship wasn't ideal.

When I incorporated TokyoDev, I had a better understanding of how taxes in Japan worked, and as the business was already doing well, also wasn't so constrained financially. I talked with several firms, and ended up going with Hisa from [J Bridge Partners](http://www.jbp-tax.jp), who was fully bilingual and could answer my questions well.

### Judicial scriveners

As an individual, you can file the paperwork necessary to create a company yourself. When I created my first company, one of my partners did this. In total, he probably ended up spending several days over a one month period getting all the paperwork in order.

When I incorporated TokyoDev, I decided to hire a "judicial scrivener" to do everything for me. I went with [SHIMAX Legal](https://shimax-legal.com/en/home-en/), who was recommended by my accountant. They offered bilingual services, and everything went smoothly.

### Governmental initiatives

In recent years there have been a number of governmental initiatives attempting to foster innovation among international entrepreneurs within specific municipalities. Through these programs you can obtain things like support with establishing your company, special entrepreneur visas, and even loans. Here's some programs I've heard of: [Shibuya Startup Support](https://shibuya-startup-support.jp), [Tokyo One-Stop Business Establishment Center](https://www.startup-support.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/onestop/en/), [Startup City Fukuoka](https://startup.fukuoka.jp), and [Startup Ecosystem Kobe](https://kobestartup.com).

### Online communities

Talking to other entrepreneurs is a great way to figure out how you should go about creating your company. [TokyoDev's Discord](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV) has an #entrepreneurship channel where software developers can talk about running a business. [HN Tokyo](http://hntokyo.io) is a Slack community where most of the active members are coming from a background in tech, and many are entrepreneurs. [Small Business Owners in Japan](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1531533572758446080) is a Twitter community that's  contains entrepreneurs of all sorts, including those running brick and mortar businesses. [Business in Japan](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/54168/) is a LinkedIn community with over 70,000 members, making it probably the biggest international online community about Japan.

### Podcasts

There's a couple of English language podcasts that provide business advice about Japan. [Disrupting Japan](https://www.disruptingjapan.com) tells the stories of founders of Japanese startups. [Japan's Venture Leaders](https://anchor.fm/kento-akiyama) also speaks with Japan-based founders. [Scaling Japan](https://scalingyourcompany.com/the-scaling-japan-podcast/) provides Japan-specific advice about growing your business.

    <content type="html">My background is as a developer, but I've been running my own business since 2008. For advice about business, I've always found other entrepreneurial developers are the best source, as they tend to have faced similar challenges to my own. If you're a developer starting your own business, the follow are some great resources for you.

#### Hacker News
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is an aggregator for startup / tech related news. It's been my gateway to most of the rest of the resources on this list.

#### Jason Cohen

Jason Cohen is an entrepreneur that has the combination of a developer background, and great writing and speaking skills. [His blog](http://blog.asmartbear.com/) is great, but his presentations are always what blow me a way. If you're getting started, I highly recommend "From geek to entrepreneur: Sifting through the Bull5h1t" and ["Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business"](http://vimeo.com/74338272).

#### Patrick McKenzie

Patrick's heavy presence on Hacker News led me to [his blog](http://www.kalzumeus.com/) pretty early on. Being a fellow resident of Japan, and an occassional attendee of the [Hacker News Tokyo Meetups](http://hntokyo.doorkeeper.jp/) makes him the only person on this list I've had the chance to talk to on a semi-regular basis.

#### Rob Walling
I read [Rob](http://www.softwarebyrob.com/)'s book [Start Small, Stay Small](http://www.startupbook.net/) pretty early on, which although it is a bit dated, is a good into to the idea of Bootsrapping a software business. His weekly podcast he cohosts with [Mike Taber](http://www.singlefounder.com/), [Startups for the Rest of Us](http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/) is something that I regularily look forward too, and he also organizes [Microconf](http://www.microconf.com/), which although I haven't attended yet, has some great videos in the archives.

#### Brennan Dunn

As opposed to the other resources, [Brennan Dunn](http://brennandunn.com/) tends to write more about freelancing than building your own product. In addition to the material on his personal site, there is also some good advice on [his product's blog](http://planscope.io/blog/).

#### Business of Software Conference

Along with MicroConf, the [Business of Software](http://businessofsoftware.org/) is the best conference for developers interested in entrepreneurship (well, I've never actually attended, but enjoy watching their videos).

    <title>International Developer in Japan Salary Survey 2014</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/japanese-developer-salary"/>
    <id>https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/japanese-developer-salary</id>
    <published>2014-02-13T10:00:00+09:00</published>

    </author>
    <content type="html">*This survey has become a yearly thing. Browse [all our survey results](/insights).*

One of the questions I've been asked several times by readers of this blog are [what are salaries of developers in Japan](/articles/software-developer-salaries-in-japan). There is a fair amount of data available about salaries for Japanese developers, but I wasn't aware of anything for international developers.

I'm active in the developer community here, so I created a survey which I sent out to my network. I got fifteen replies - not enough to come to any statistically valid conclusions, but got some interesting responses nevertheless.

In this article, I'll give the average yearly salary of developers based on several criteria.

First off, which is better, working for a company headquartered in Japan, or working for a foreign owned subsidiary?

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Company Type&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Average Salary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Japanese Company&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥8 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Foreign Subsidiary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥11 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Perhaps not surprisingly, international companies pay better than Japanese ones. Part of this could be that companies having subsidiaries in Japan are going to be established companies.

Related to this, how does the size of the company change compensation?

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Number of Employees&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Average Salary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;150 or less employees&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥6 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;150 to 1500 employees&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥11 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Over 1500 employees&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥9 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Mid-sized companies seem to pay the best. This could be because they are established enough that they aren't trying to penny-pinch, while still not so big that an individual developer becomes a cog in the machine.

Next up, are you paid better at a company where you speak mostly in Japanese or English?

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Primary Spoken Language&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Average Salary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Spoke mostly English&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥5 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Spoke English / Japanese equally&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥10 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Spoke mostly Japanese&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥9 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Well it turns out developers who mostly spoke English didn't get compensated nearly as well as those who used Japanese. There are probably a couple of reasons for this. First, if you are fluent in Japanese, there are a lot more opportunities available. Second, people who are using both English and Japanese are likely in a position where they are acting as a bridge between Japanese / International teams, which makes them more valuable.

Finally, what programming language should you use if you want to get paid well?

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Programming Language&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Average Salary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Javascript&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥8 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Ruby&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥8 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;PHP&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥5 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Python&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;¥7 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

PHP loses out here, so if you're still programming in it, maybe its time to pick up a new language.

I hope this data helps people get a rough idea of what salaries are like here, but remember to take it with a grain of salt.

    </author>
    <content type="html">At the last [Hacker News Tokyo Meetup](http://hntokyo.doorkeeper.jp/), I met Paulo, who is the lead software developer at [Crowdcast](http://crowdcast.jp/), a Japanese startup with a product, [bizNote](https://secure.biznote.jp/) that makes small business accounting easier. As it turns out, Paulo had earlier found this blog, and we had talked about how to find a job in Japan. Paulo was looking to find a job at a Japanese startup, and he accomplished that objective, so I thought talking a bit about his experiences might help other readers.

#### Why did you decide to work in Japan?

I have always been interested in Asian culture in general, with both interests specifically in China and Japan. Having visited Hong Kong five years ago, I had decided that I would leave London once I had some work experience that made me worthwhile for a company to sponsor a visa.

Last year I finally visited Tokyo twice, and both my girlfriend and I decided that we would like to live here. The job market for expats is currently in demand and finding a position at a good startup isn't as difficult as other countries. The general start up market right now is also starting to grow, so its a good opportunity to join at the start of the boom and make a name for yourself.

#### When you were searching for jobs, were you still abroad?

I was searching from London. Everyday I looked at different job boards to see if any new positions had been advertised. It's pretty difficult to hunt down jobs as most companies do not use job boards so actively searching for startups in town is a good bet. Sometimes they have their own careers page and you get lucky, or others you just have to get in touch with them and ask if they have any positions available.

Then it comes the difficult task of interviewing via Skype! Mostly at a fairly awkward hour for anyone in London at a full time job. Its difficult and can take a while. It took me six months, but in the end I had maybe fifteen interviews with different companies including Cookpad and Rakuten at the larger end, and companies with two people at the smaller end!

#### Why was Crowd Cast a good match? What did you like about them and why do you think they hired you?

[Crowd Cast](/companies/crowdcast) was a good match for me in terms of the size. I had previously worked on the agency side (advertising) and for the last three years I had been at a conversion agency that was a start up. We went from three people to twelve, and no clients to some of the biggest names, not only in the UK but internationally. I felt that my experience in conversion, startup culture, and want for moving from the agency side made a good match with Crowd Cast. I also liked the fact that we currently had no in-house development team, and I would be able to shape the development of the company and department.

I guess they hired me for the same reasons I wanted to work with them. I had pretty good startup experience, big connections and ties to Japan (my girlfriend had moved here in April, though I was in London until October, and I had many friends in Tokyo) meant that I was less risky than other overseas candidates. This along with my experience in conversion and the overall business side of running a startup made me fairly compatible with their needs.


#### Can you tell me a bit more about Crowd Cast?

Crowd Cast is a small startup that has been around for a few years. However in the last six months we have started to bring development and project management in house. I am the first international team member, however everyone in the company speaks English and have worked at multinationals such as Microsoft and LINE. We have some really talented members already and are looking to expand. We are looking to expand with international members because this give us a better opportunity to find more talented individuals with good industry experience.

The working conditions are very welcoming here and can be even more welcoming than western companies. We typically work 9-6, though flextime is welcome as long as you are around from 11am to 3pm. We are working from a really great shared office in Shibuya, so we are really centrally located and you get to see and talk to new people everyday.

    <title>The Downside of Thanking Security Contributors</title>

    <content type="html">My startup is an popular event management platform within the Japan tech community. We've occasionally gotten reports about security issues, and although we're a two-person company, we still take security seriously, so we decided to create security and responsible disclosure pages. As part of this, we created a section thanking people who had reported security issues to us.

The day after putting up the page, I got a mail "Reporting Stored XSS Vulnerability". We're using Ruby on Rails, which has built in functionality to mitigate these kind of attacks, so I was surprised to see such an issue being reported. However, I was able to verify it and fix [the problem in the library](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2013/11/xss-vulnerability-on-simple-form/) that was causing it.

There was one thing that irked me at the end of his email:

&gt; P.S: If you would like to thank me, this is my paypal address: example@example.com

We hadn't done anything to actively solicit people to find vulnerabilities in our site, so I found it a bit strange to have someone seeking compensation for it. I responded saying we don't have any bounty program, but we would add him to the list of contributors. As I was curious why he decided to investigate our site, I asked him, but I didn't hear anything back.

About a week later, I woke up to find six mails regarding security issues. Looking at our referrers, it seems someone added us to [a list of bug bounties](http://www.bugsheet.com/bug-bounties), where we were listed next to companies like eBay, Evernote, Fog Creek, and Foursquare. Generally speaking, I'd be happy to be in the same list as them, but in this case we simply don't have the same resources to designate to bug hunters as them.

Most of those initial mails were regarding the X-Frame-Options header, that helps to combat [clickjacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking). At this stage, the likelihood that someone is going to target us with this kind of attack is pretty low, but nevertheless, I set it.

Two more people pointed out that we weren't doing anything to prevent brute forcing of account login. Indeed we weren't, and this was probably the most serious reported vulnerability. We implemented locking for accounts after many consecutive login attempts.

The last was that our nginx version had a security vulnerability in it. Indeed it did, although I don't think we were using it in such a way that we would have been susceptible to it. Of course, we still did the upgrade.

Rather than by the issues themselves, I felt overwhelmed by the reporters. What's the etiquette in this case? If multiple people report the same vulnerability, am I supposed to add them all to our list of security contributors? How about if they report something like the nginx issue, where it is a potential issue, but there is no reason to believe we would actually be subject to it?

Since that initial burst, we've continued to receive at least a couple of mails a day. After we asked them to, the bug bounty site removed us, but the reports continue. Furthermore, all the reports are about non issues. For instance,

* A user could create a link to another site that has malicious content. We are intentionally allowing a subset of HTML.
* A cookie is not marked as HTTP Only. We only use the cookie to store the users preferred locale.
* Our site can be DOSed by automating the submission of a form.

Not only are they reporting trivial issues, but they also aren't testing our site in a respectful fashion, by doing stuff like signing up to real events with fake profiles.

At this point, I regret adding the contributors page. What was meant as a way to thank the people who helped us is now being treated as an open invitation to try to hack our site. If they were reporting serious issues it would be one thing, but I don't want to spend time confirming every issue is actually a non issue. If I remove the list of contributors, will they stop? Or is the genie out the bottle now and I'm doomed to keep having to deal with these people?

    <content type="html">The [first pair programming event](https://trbmeetup.doorkeeper.jp/events/1777) of Tokyo Rubyist Meetup went event better than I expected it to. The event was hosted at [HatchUp's TechBuzz space](http://www.socialtoprunners.jp/techbuzz/), and started with an introduction to pair programming by [Johnny Mukai](http://www.johnnymukai.com/), where he talked about how Pivotal Labs does pair programming, and answered questions about how pair programming works.

After Johnny's introduction, I assigned teams and then revealed [the first programming challenge](https://github.com/tokyo-rubyist-meetup/pair-programming-1a). Immediately, people began working together to solve the problem, and as the video below shows, the atmosphere was very lively.

&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gPT-sSq8iEM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Tokyo Rubyist Meetup originally set out to bridge the gap between the international and Japanese Ruby communities. From this perspective, the event was the most successful one yet, as by pairing Japanese and international people, it gave people who would not normally communicate with each other an opportunity to do so.

Based on the success of this event, I plan to hold another one. Join [Tokyo Rubyist Meetup](http://trbmeetup.doorkeeper.jp/) to get a notification about the next one.

    <content type="html">After years of living in a cramped Tokyo apartment, I'm going to move to a slightly more spacious one. Finding an apartment went smoother than I could have imagined, and in half-a-day, I had found a new apartment. The following day I set out to take care of the tasks surrounding the move.

First up is finding a mover. After some searching, I come across 価格.com's moving company estimate site. 価格.com is a price comparison site, which I've used in the past to find deals on electronics. I decide to try them out, and fill out their form with the details of my current place and the place I'm moving to.

Within a minute of submitting my information, my phone rings. I answer, and it is a moving company calling to confirm my details. I spend about ten minutes going through my details, and receive a quote.

When I hang up the phone, I notice that I have four missed calls. It hits me: all the estimate service does is submit my information to all the companies that have registered to it.

The companies are like sharks that have just smelled fresh blood, and are swarming on me. The moving companies must have people ready to pounce on any lead that comes in, racing to make the call before their peers. I wonder if these ferocious companies will really give me a good deal, or will try to fleece me.

I realize I don't want to deal with these companies. But it is too late, as they have my phone number already. Ignoring email is a lot easier than ignoring a ringing phone. By the end of the day, I've received fifteen calls from different moving companies.

The moving company estimate site provided me with a horrible experience. With the internet, we are used to it being a passive experience. We can browse at our own pace, stopping at any time. This *service* broke that paradigm, making me fend off different moving companies. The only thing that they automated was the submission of my information to more companies than I would have ever wanted.

The user experience here is broken for everyone. The potential customers get overwhelmed by the companies calling them. The companies waste time calling people who don't want to talk to them. 価格.com's service shouldn't exist as it stands.

Oh yeah, and while I was writing this post, I got yet another call from a moving company.

    <title>A Proposal for the Translation of RubyKaigi</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/a-proposal-for-the-translation-of-rubykaigi"/>

    <content type="html">[RubyKaigi](http://rubykaigi.org/) and more recently [Sapporo Ruby Kaigi](http://sapporo.rubykaigi.org/2012/en/) have been providing realtime translation services. The way this has worked is that volunteers listen to the speakers presentation, and simultaneously translate it to an IRC channel that is broadcast next to the main screen, like the photo below.

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machu/5950666816/" title="RubyKaigi 2011 by machu., on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6017/5950666816_8858bf08fc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RubyKaigi 2011"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

At RubyKaigi 2011, I tried to help, but my Japanese skills were not up to the task. When I was asked to help doing the same thing for Sapporo Ruby Kaigi, I initially refused, but after some persuasion, I agreed to do "backup" translation. However, when the conference actually started, I realized that if I didn't step up, many of the Japanese presentations would go untranslated. So I ended up doing a lot more translation then I anticipated. For less technical presentations, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, and as the event went on, some of the audience also helped out with translation (my thanks especially to [@sora_h](https://twitter.com/sora_h) and [@lchin](https://twitter.com/lchin)).

During and after the conference, I was grateful for all the thanks I received for my translations. Having bilingual RubyKaigi are very important to encourage the exchange of ideas. However, the process we are using to do simultaneous translation needs to be improved as it suffers from many issues:

* Too few translators
* No opportunity to understand the presentation material before hand
* Often hard to quickly come up with a translation
* Typing is slower than speaking, so even in the best case, content goes untranslated

On Saturday morning, before [Ryunosuke Sato's presentation](http://sapporo.rubykaigi.org/2012/en/schedule/details/75.html), I had the opportunity to review his slides. Because the slides were only in Japanese, but were quite verbose, I decided to translate them. Then as he did the presentation, I pasted the translations into IRC, occasionally quickly adding something on the spot when he strayed from them. This process worked a lot better for me, and got me thinking about how if we did more preparation in advance, we could make it easier at the conference itself.

## The Proposed New Process

1. After the schedule is published, a translator will choose a couple of presentations that match their interests and abilities.
2. The translator schedules a Skype call with the speaker before the conference (say a week in advance)
3. The speaker does the presentation over Skype (screen sharing could be useful here), and the translator makes translation notes
4. At RubyKaigi itself, the translator broadcasts translation based on previous notes (exact method still undecided)

This process would require more effort per presentation (I estimate 2-4 hours per 30 minute presentation), but would then be less demanding on the day of the conference itself. Because of the extra time, translators could produce higher quality translations, and people who might not have the ability to do something in realtime could still help out. Because the job of translating would become easier, we could recruit more translators. This would allow us to divide up the work better, meaning that translators would have less responsibility during the conference. The idea would require the cooperation of the speakers, but the one speaker I did talk to about it was enthusiastic about it.

This is just a skeleton of the process, and I think there is still room for more improvement, but I wanted to get my thoughts out while Sapporo Ruby Kaigi is still fresh in everyone's mind. I'm happy if you have any thoughts or suggestions on the idea.

&lt;/div&gt;

I'm writing this from the Starbucks in the Sapporo Grand Hotel. When I arrived, there was already [another Rubyist here](https://twitter.com/igaiga555/status/247511186394972160). Five minutes before, I met [another one](https://twitter.com/yotii23) walking down the street. Last night, I went into a Sapporo bar, and [a speaker was there](http://dane.heroku.com/), and soon after, I saw [yet another Rubyist](https://path.com/p/ToIzU) passing by, and called him to join us. This kind of serendipity is what made [Sapporo Ruby Kaigi 2012](http://sapporo.rubykaigi.org/2012/) such a wonderful conference.

My first Sapporo Ruby Kaigi was in [2010](http://regional.rubykaigi.org/sapporo03/). With only about 120 participants, it was much smaller in size than Ruby Kaigi's 700+ people. Despite its relatively small size, the organizers put together a top-notch programme. I felt very fortunate that I could participate in it, as I thoroughly enjoyed being part of a community of such passionate people.

When Sapporo Ruby Kaigi 2012 (sprk2012) was announced, [the announcement](http://rubykaigi.tdiary.net/20120201.html) was in both English and Japanese. This was the first time a Regional RubyKaigi had provided bilingual information, but at the time, I didn't think much of it, besides being excited to attend myself. Later, [Kazuya Numata](https://twitter.com/kaznum) reached out to me for help with improving the English communication, I was more than happy to help, both because I had enjoyed the previous one so much, and that it aligned with my goal of making the Japanese Ruby community more international.

The Japanese Ruby community has traditionally divided Ruby conferences into international bilingual ones (*the* Ruby Kaigi), and domestic Japanese only ones (Regional Ruby Kaigi). A big part of this is the language barrier. As most Japanese Rubyists are not comfortable in English, they want to talk about Ruby in Japanese. Because they worry that non-Japanese Rubyists would not enjoy a Japanese language conference, all previous Regional Ruby Kaigi have had no English information.

With sprk2012, the organizers went all out with internationalization. Two of the three keynote speakers were from outside of Japan. About a third of the other speakers were. Ten percent of the attendees were. As much as possible, the conference was bilingual. I'm really glad that people from all over the world were able to enjoy sprk2012, and am thankful to the organizers for making it an international Regional Ruby Kaigi.

I hope other Regional Ruby Kaigi are inspired by sprk2012 and try to be a bit more international. There are many non-Japanese Rubyists who are looking for an excuse to travel to and around Japan, and Regional Ruby Kaigi are a perfect opportunity. However, without any English information, even those who speak some Japanese are unlikely to find out about Regional Ruby Kaigi, so even having a little bit of English would go a long way. One good example of how this could be done is [Tokyo Ruby Kaigi 10](http://tokyo10.rubykaigi.info/en), and I would be happy to help any other Regional Ruby Kaigi similarity accessible.

The international nature of the conference seemed to tie in with one of the themes that emerged at sprk2012: diversity. Presenters encouraged technical diversity (Matz's "One size does not fit all"), involving more women in the Ruby community (Rails Girls), and more cross cultural communication (Yoko Harada's "Why Don't You Go To Conferences In US?" and try :english). Diversity is one thing Japan has traditionally lacked, so I'm glad to see that the Ruby community sees it as a priority.

Thank you to all the organizers of Sapporo Ruby Kaigi, you made it a really memorable experience. I'm already looking forward to the next Sapporo Ruby Kaigi.

    <content type="html">One area I'm interested in is how people find jobs. The "traditional" way to find a job of sending out your resume to lots of companies and hoping for the best is clearly broken. Despite this, people all around the world, but especially in Japan, cling to it. So I got excited when I heard about [Forkwell](http://forkwell.com), a service that is trying to change this

Forkwell is a aims to be the LinkedIn for geeks. Although most of the users are currently in Japan, the service has a global focus, offering it in both English and Japanese.

At the core of the system is the ability for user's to register skills they are proficient in, such as git or ruby. The peers of the user can then indicate that he is infact proficient by +1'ing the skill. This way, users can show off their skills.

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://forkwell.com/u/paul.w.i.mcmahon"&gt;My profile&lt;/a&gt; on Forkwell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

[Yuka Ouka](http://forkwell.com/u/oukayuka), one of the directors of Garbs, the company that built Forkwell, is also a frequent participant of [Tokyo Rubyist Meetup](https://trbmeetup.doorkeeper.jp/). I interviewed Yuka last week about the service, and translated it from Japanese to English below.

## How did you come up with the idea for Forkwell?

Originally, Forkwell was going to be a social recruiting service. Recently in Japan, companies looking for engineers ask their employees to recruit their friends, and if the friend is hired, the employee will get a bonus of say three hundred thousand yen. So, we thought we could do this as a social networking service.

In America, there's a similar service called [Top Prospect](http://www.topprospect.com/).  With the service, you login using Facebook or LinkedIn, get a list of jobs, and if you introduce someone to one of those jobs successfully, you will a bonus. We wanted to do something similar to that in Japan.

However, Top Prospect turned out to be unpopular, and the idea of sending job introductions out of the blue didn't seem appealing at all to the people I talked to. Instead of being so direct about it, we thought having a social networking service more like Facebook or LinkedIn, where job information could be introduced in a more casual manner would be better.

While originally we're going to focused on facilitating employee referrals, which we are still planning on doing, we thought it was important to start off by having something that was fun for engineers to use. So that's why we started off by releasing features like skill tags and +1 for skills.

## Why did you decide to release Forkwell in both English and Japanese?

We wanted to make a global service, not something that was used just in Japan. Recently we've seen the release of lots of SNS services targeting geeks, like [coderwall](http://coderwall.com/) and [geeklist](http://geekli.st/). In Japan too, services like [hat.io](https://hat.io/) by Recruit have come out. Geeks don't use LinkedIn much, because it feels like it's just for suits, so I think everyone sees that there is an opportunity to make a LinkedIn for geeks. We want to be a part of this, and have people from all over the world use our service.

## How are you planning on promoting Forkwell abroad?

Right now, [Akira Matsuda](http://forkwell.com/users/13) is at RailsConf, and he's giving out stickers. We also received investment from a venture capital firm, so we're considering hiring a company to promote it abroad.

## How are you planning on monetizing Forkwell?

Companies looking for engineers will post jobs. Forkwell's users will then be able to add a comment to the position and share it with friends. For instance, if a company posts a job looking for a Ruby on Rails engineer to help them make games, I might share a posting within Forkwell saying that I've worked for them before, and it's a good company, so if you're a Rails developer, why don't you apply. If one of my friends then applies for the job through Forkwell, I can write a reference for him. If my friend is hired, I'll receive the reward offered by the company, say 300,000 JPY, and garbs will get thirty percent, so in this case, 90,000 JPY.

## What motivation do companies have to use Forkwell?

Recently, Japanese companies often ask recruiting agents to introduce employees. These agents collect people who are looking for a job, and will introduce those people to companies, regardless of whether or not they are actually skilled for the position. So it's up to the companies themselves to decide whether or not a person is skilled enough. I've heard from companies that only about one out of a hundred people that agents introduce are skilled enough. Despite this, if the companies hire that one person, they still need to pay 30% of the first year's salary. So the cost-performance for these agents is really bad.

We saw this problem, so we're focusing on introducing skilled engineers. Additionally, Forkwell is a lot cheaper than these agents.

## Why would an engineer use forkwell?

For talented engineers, it is important to see what kind of environment they'll be working in. For instance, for a Rails developer, he'll want to work at a company that is using git and the newest version of Rails, and do development in an agile fashion. But it's hard to see what a normal company is like. If they use Forkwell, you can see that your friend, or friend of friend works at that company. If a skilled engineer is working at that company, then the company is probably a good place to work.

## In Japan, it seems like engineers don't recruit their peers so much. Why do you think this is?

I think they are apprehensive about taking on the responsibility of recruiting someone. For instance, if they recruit a friend, and then the friend quits soon after, they feel responsible for it. In Japan, there isn't a culture of going through people when applying for jobs. In America and Europe, rather than directly sending your resume by email, you might ask your peers if they know of a good company. Once someone introduces a job, then you'll apply for it. With this method, because the introducer is thinking about both parties, I think it is rarer for people to get hired to a position that doesn't match their expectations, or a company to hire someone who wasn't as skilled as they thought he was. We want to encourage this method in Japan, and thought by building Forkwell we could help make the process smoother.

## Compared to before, the culture of changing jobs in Japan is changing...

Companies like Gree and Cookpad, who are making their own web services, are recruiting people who used to work as “SIers”. Right now, its just the top engineers who are changing jobs, but starting from this year or next, I think we'll see this trend spreading downwards. We hope that Forkwell will add momentum to this movement.

## What's been the biggest challenge for you with Forkwell?

There aren't any services like Forkwell in Japan, and even abroad, services like this aren't so common, so people don't readily understand it. It has been especially challenging to explain it to people who aren't engineers, as I need to explain how geeks think, and what kind of service appeals to them.

    <content type="html">My first job was as [a Ruby developer at a Japanese startup](/articles/finding-a-job-as-a-ruby-developer-in-japan). The company had a stellar development team, and in a couple of months of working there I learned more about developing software than I did in my entire computer science degree.

The rest of the company was, well, it was hard to tell. You see, even though the company was only about thirty five people, we had a development team, an operations team, an operator team, a sales team, and a human resources team. Furthermore, there wasn't much collaboration between the teams. Part of this was language issues (the development team was filled with English speakers, whereas the rest of the company was Japanese), but I also remember a manager telling me something like "it's my job to insulate you from all the chaos outside the department so you can concentrate on coding". At the time, I didn't think too deeply about the implications of that statement, because I was grateful that I could do a job I liked, surrounded by other professionals I respected, and although I was a bit disappointed I didn't get to interact more with the rest of the company, I coded on in happy oblivion.

Meanwhile, the company wasn't doing so well. It's telling that almost every party we had at the company was a going away party. Slowly our numbers dwindled. As the company struggled, it decided it's new mantra would be "cut costs". Measures like having the employees clean the toilets instead of paying for a janitor (so everyone could pitch in!) were put into place. Frequent all-hands meetings were held and we were presented with reams of financial data in incomprehensible formats. But the organization structure remained the same, and day-to-day life remained largely unchanged.

At the same time, the company decided to create a new product. I first heard about it by being asked to develop the server side component (a client application had already been developed by an outside contractor, but that's another story). Looking at the effort create the product, plus the cost of running the service, the product didn't make sense to me. So I came up with a spreadsheet that had a user growth model in it, and calculated the potential revenue. It appeared to me that even ignoring all the sunk costs up to that point, it would take us years to recover the additional costs we would incur in completing the development. I shared it with the president, but was shrugged off, and didn't ever get a response to it.

Although I was never directly told "that's not your job", I also wasn't encouraged to pursue my interest in the business side of things. This just frustrated me even more. Here I was wanting to make to help the company more money (or at least not loose money), and yet the only thing I was allowed to help the company with was coding, and it was clear to me lack of coding talent was not the source of the company's problems. Soon after that, I left to start my own company.

As a startup, your top priority must be innovation, and innovation in today's startups comes not from deep mastery of any one domain, but rather the coming together of many skill sets. By not encouraging your employees to broaden their horizons, you will fail.

    <content type="html">While I was initially a bit aprehensive at the classroom like setting for the last [Tokyo Rubyist Meetup](https://trbmeetup.doorkeeper.jp), thanks to all the great people who attended, we were able to turn it into a lively event. Anchoring the night were presentations about Heroku and Travis CI.

First up was [Ayumu Aizawa](https://twitter.com/#!/ayumin), who gave a talk about Heroku's latest and greatest features.

&lt;iframe src="http://www.ustream.tv/embed/recorded/21807464" width="608" height="368" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: 0px none transparent; margin-bottom: 20px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

For me, the most interesting part was the question and answer session (starting at about 17:20), where among other things, he described how he got hired by Heroku. Basically, it boiled down to that he just asked if Heroku needed an evangelist in Japan. This is a great lesson for developers everywhere: if there's a job you want to do, don't let the lack of an advertised position stop you. Conversely, the lack of other applicants will make you all the more likely to get it.

Next up was [Randy Morgan](https://twitter.com/#!/morgan_randy), who introduced [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) and talked about how he got involved with the project.

&lt;iframe src="http://www.ustream.tv/embed/recorded/21808058" width="608" height="368" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: 0px none transparent; margin-bottom: 20px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

As I was telling Randy later, I think Travis CI has the potential to be as revolutionary for developers as GitHub or Heroku, so check it out if you haven't yet.

Thanks to RedHat for providing the venue, and [nekop](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nekop/) for helping to get everything set up.

    <title>On the Value of Software</title>

    <content type="html">One of the biggest challenges in moving from a software developer to entrepreneur has been changing my perception of the value of software. As a developer, the underlying assumption was the more functionality software had, the more valuable it was. This proposition was comforting, as it meant the value I was creating was directly proportional to my effort creating it. Unfortunately, it was categorically wrong.

Instead of being intrinsically valuable, the value of the software to customers dictates the value. If we were to express it as an equation, we could do so with the following:

    software value = value to a customer × the number of customers

By looking at value in this way, when we have a goal for the value of our software, we can then plot our possible routes to success. For instance, if we set the value to one million dollars then we get the following.

![value graph](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTQ5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--64f0a91fd25b9165a2776056bdffd57d60b43f35/value-of-software.png)

The most important thing to note is the scale of this graph: both axis are logarithmic, so if we increase the value of our software ten times, we need ten times less customers, and vice versa.

## The Relationship Between Software Value and Difficulty

High value software is intrinsically more difficult to create than low value software, as is obtaining a large number of customers more difficult than a small number. If we construct a naïve model for difficulty, where the total difficulty is the sum of the difficulty of creating value and that of increasing the number of customers, we can add an arbitrary measurement of difficulty to our graph.

![value graph](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTQ5MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6892e923f0ae51c4396fbe926f33f597017ba13e/value-of-software-customers.png)
Although the value of the minima depends on the ratio of the two difficulties, it lies somewhere in the center of the graph.

## Implications on Funded vs Bootstraped Startups

One fundamental difference between funded and bootstrapped startups is how they approach risk. The primary goal of a funded startup is to maximize return on investment. In exchange for this, they can take large risks, and don't need to see immediate returns. However, bootsrapped startups need to focus on minimizing risk over maximizing return, and should see a return on investment as soon as possible.

Following from this, a bootstraped startup should focus on striking a balance between customers and value. This is exactly the advice we've heard time and again from the likes of 37signals, one of the most successful bootstraped software startups.

Your value proposition is at the core of your startup. By being aware of it, and the implications of it, you can dramatically increase your chances of success.

    <content type="html">Eric Ries [defines a minimum viable product](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) as

&gt; that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort

As a developer, it is tempting to start by building a working protype with a minimal features. However, this is rarely the right way to go, as the first step is to validate the concept of the startup. If you try to do this with the prototype, prospective users will give you feedback aimed at improving the product, rather than the concept itself. For instance, it doesn't matter if a feature is missing or there is a bug, if you are building something no one actually wants.

37Signals says you should [ignore details early on](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Ignore_Details_Early_On.php) and work from large to small. This same advice is applicable to an MVP. Much like they argue against using Photoshop for doing mockups, because it makes it too tempting to add too much details, but rather advocate doing simple line drawings, your first MVP shouldn't actually work.  Instead you should start by creating a landing page that describes how the product works and a signup button. Then you can direct traffic to it using AdWords, and see if anyone actually clicks through. This forces you to spell out your value proposition, and gives you impartial feedback.

Validating your value proposition is a hard thing to do. As a developer it's easy to ignore that a product needs to be sufficiently valuable to be successful. If you're building something for the fun of it, it's fine to skip this validation, but if you are trying to build a startup, it needs to be at the top of your list.

    <content type="html">Tonight I had a chance to talk with one of my personal heroes, [Eric
Ries](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/). While talking to him, I
realized one of the pitfalls of [the Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mobalean-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307887898.&lt;img) src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mobalean-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307887898" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;

At the center of the Lean Startup is the idea of the build-measure-learn
cycle: that from a hypothesis, you can build something, measure the
results, from them validate your hypothesis, and then iterate again. As
a software developer, the idea of turning a startup into a scientific
experiment is very seductive.

The allure of the idea is that it turns something that is hard for us to
understand (people) in to something that is easy for us to understand
(numbers). However, this is also the very thing that makes it so
dangerous, as it gives us an excuse not to talk to customers, something
that many of coming from a developer background tend to shy away from.

    <title>Entry Level Jobs in Japan</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">*Since writing this article, I've written [Getting your first programming job in Japan](/articles/first-job-programmer-japan), which goes into a lot more detail than this one.*

When I was first looking for a job in Japan, I was surprised by the lack of entry level positions. In fact, I think the job I got was the the only position recruiting a “junior developer”. After understanding how Japanese companies recruit university students, I now understand why this is the case.

Japan has a peculiar system known as &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;新卒一括採用&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;しんそついっかつさいよう&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt; where university students are recruited on mass. Rather than being hired for any specific position, students are hired under the special banner of “new graduate”.  The first three months of employment normally entail learning the company culture, after which they’ll be dispatched to specific positions.

Companies will recruit students while they are still in university. Students will normally begin the job hunt during third year, with the hope to secure a job offer by the end of academic year. If they receive a job offer, normally the only thing they need to do is ensure they graduate, which in Japan is basically guaranteed.

However, if they don’t secure employment by graduation, they enter something of a no-man’s land. They are neither “new graduates” nor “mid-career”, the two acceptable designations when job hunting. So extreme is the bias against these people that students who have not received an offer may delay their graduation or go on to graduate school simply to give them another chance.

Given this situation, it’s not surprising that I wasn’t able to find entry level positions: by in large they simply didn’t exist. So if your not Japanese, how can you land your first job here?

## Come to Japan

Being in Japan is pretty much a prerequisite to getting a job here. There are many opportunities to be had here that you won’t find on any job board, and even if you do manage to find a position online, anyone who is already here will automatically be more attractive than you.

## Academia

Compared with the corporate world, it seems to be relatively easy to get a research position in Japan. This is out of my area of expertise, but if you currently have a field of research you are in, you might try asking any professors in Japan in the same field if you can get a position with them.

## JET Programme

This is a government run programme that brings international people to often-rural areas of Japan to encourage cultural exchange. Most positions are for teaching English, but depending on your Japanese and other skills, you might be able to land an administrative position. Most of the people I know with fluent Japanese started out on this programme, so it could be a good springboard into Japan.

## Internships

As far as I’m aware, Japanese companies don’t offer internships to students after graduation. The internships that are available to students tend to be part-time office work. Even if you were eligible for such an internship, I think there are probably visa-issues that would arise from doing it. So unless you are doing an internship through some special programme offered through your university, I’d steer clear of them and instead focus on finding normal employment.

    <content type="html">How I came to Japan
-------------------

During the first day of the first computer science course I took, I
happened to sit next to a Japanese woman. Over the semester, we became
friends, and I remember many a lunch we had together, where she would
tell me about life in Japan. Because Vancouver has many immigrants,
growing up I had friends who had come over with their parents, but she
was my first friend who came to Canada by herself. My friendship with
her was the start of my interest in Japan.

Throughout university, I made several more Japanese friends. I also
found out about the [Co-op Japan
Program](http://www.thecoopjapanprogram.com/), through which I could do
an internship in Japan. I thought that program sounded interesting and
decided I would do it. However, after investigating it more thoroughly,
I discovered I would need to delay my graduation a year for a chance to
do it.

In the summer of 2005, I got a new roommate in the shared house I was
living in. He had just come back from a year in Japan on the [Working
Holiday visa](/articles/japanese-engineering-visa-options). I
decided that I'd skip the Co-op Japan Program, and try going to Japan on
a Working Holiday after I graduated instead.

That same summer, I also got a Japanese girlfriend. She was in Canada on
a Working Holiday. We continued our relationship until she had to return
in February of the following year, and then decided to continue in a
long distance relationship until I went to Japan in the summer.

How I found a Job
-----------------

With the Working Holiday visa, you are not allowed to have a job offer
before you go to the country you are doing the holiday in. However,
about a month before I went, I decided to get a feeling for the job
situation in Tokyo. Most of the job postings either required a high
level of Japanese or extensive software development experience, neither
of which I had. Furthermore, the postings themselves all sounded generic
and uninteresting. However, I found one posting that sounded different -
a company called [Ubit](http://ubit.com/) was looking for a junior
developer to develop a mobile CMS using the Ruby programming language. I
sent the company the following email:

&gt; Dear Sir or Madam,
&gt;
&gt; I am applying for the position of Junior Developer. In mid-August I am
&gt; coming to Japan on the Working Holiday Visa, and while looking for
&gt; potential jobs I came across ubit. Although I was not planning on
&gt; applying to jobs until I arrived in Japan, I did not want to risk having
&gt; the position close, as ubit appears to be my ideal company. ubit
&gt; attracted me because it is a small company, with motivated and talented
&gt; employees.
&gt;
&gt; I have just completed my BSc in Computer Science, and am going to Japan
&gt; with the hope of finding related work. Although my Working Holiday Visa
&gt; is good only for a year, I am interested in continuing working in Japan
&gt; by obtaining a regular working visa. I want to work in Japan because it
&gt; is a very different culture from Canada, but has similar standards of
&gt; living.
&gt;
&gt; Last summer, I worked for [redacted], a company that develops web
&gt; services such as message boards and web surveys. I improved and
&gt; maintained the services using primarily php and mysql. The company took
&gt; an anarchistic approach to software development, not using any software
&gt; development methodology. Because of this, I felt though they made short
&gt; term gains, their software quality and productivity suffered over the
&gt; long term. Thus, I am excited to see that ubit emphasizes software
&gt; development methodologies.
&gt;
&gt; これまで３ヶ月日本語を勉強してきました。
&gt; 私の日本語はまだまだ不十分ですが、英語と日本語を話す人と仕事をして、これからも勉強したいです。
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Paul McMahon

Looking back at this email five years later, having had experience
recruiting people, it does not surprise me I managed to get an
interview. For a small company, the most essential thing to demonstrate
is that you want to work for that company. I genuinely was excited at
the prospect of working for Ubit, and I think my email conveyed that.

A month later, in August of 2006, I arrived in Japan. I moved in with my
girlfriend, and soon after, had my interview at Ubit. While waiting to
hear back from Ubit, I did touristy things during the day, coming home
to prepare dinner for my girlfriend in the evening. Because we were
sharing an apartment on the outskirts of Tokyo, our rent was quite
cheap, and I didn't feel in any hurry to get a job. However, as weeks
dragged on, with no outright rejection, but no offer either, I started
half-heartedly applying to other positions. I never heard anything back
from the other companies, but about a month after my initial interview
with Ubit, they made me an offer.

I started working at Ubit from October 2006. The company pretty much
matched my expectations. In the first three months working there, I
learned more about software development than I did in my entire
University education. Most of all, I was glad to be surrounded by
passionate software developers - people who strived to improve their
craft and themselves.

## What I got paid

As a naive fresh grad, it didn't even occur to me to try to negotiate my offer with Ubit. So when they offered me a starting salary of ¥3.4 million, I took it. It was roughly what I had been earning through the co-op program in Canada, and so it seemed reasonable enough. About a year later, I remember the CEO saying they were really pleased with my performance, and gave me a raise to ¥4.5 million.

However, only a couple months after that, the company said they were doing rough fiscally, and asked employees to voluntarily lower their compensation. Still naive, I just signed the paper, and now my salary was down to ¥3.8 million.

When I was doing this, I was flying blind to what a reasonable salary was. The only data point I would get was when I noticed another developer was getting paid significantly more than me. They were admittedly more experienced than me, but that didn't stop me from thinking I deserved more (though I didn't take action on it).

Luckily, now there's not only a lot more information available about this, including an article I wrote on [software developer salaries in Japan](/articles/software-developer-salaries-in-japan).

## Leaving Ubit

While Ubit was a great place to work from an engineering perspective, it's perhaps not shocking that they weren't in such a good position business wise. More than the personal pay cut, I began to get frustrated that they needed to do something radically different with it, but seemed to frightened to take the leap.

So in December of 2008, I left Ubit to [start my own company in Japan](/articles/creating-company-japan). Since then, I've established two other companies, including TokyoDev, and haven't actually worked for someone else since (though I've helped plenty of others find a job here).



Advice for Finding a Job
------------------------

### Learn Japanese

When I came to Japan, I had minimal Japanese skills. While it is
possible to get a job in Japan with little to no Japanese, the greater
your Japanese skills, the more options you have. If you aren't fluent,
consider spending your first year or two studying Japanese.
Alternatively, the [JET program](http://www.jetprogramme.org/) is a good
way to learn Japanese - many of the foreigners I know who are fluent
have come to Japan through this program.

### Be in Japan

The best way to find a job in Japan is to be here. Not only does it
allow you to interview directly with potential companies, but also
allows you to get involved in the local community. The working holiday
visa program is a great option as if you get a job offer, you can start
working right away.

### Get Involved in the Community

Many positions are never advertised on job boards. By getting
involved in the local community, many more options will open up. There are many great [tech meetups in Tokyo](/articles/tech-meetups-in-tokyo) you can attend to make connections with other developers.

### Contribute to Open Source

By contributing to Open Source, you can show not only you have
development skills, but also that you have a similar ethos to your
fellow developers. As a Ruby developer, your
[github](https://github.com/) profile is your resume.

### More advice

I've written a longer article on [finding your first developer job in Japan](/articles/first-job-programmer-japan) that goes into more detail about how you can get hired here.

    <content type="html">I updated my blog from my own homebrew Rails application to
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/), a blogging framework backed by the
static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I first read about
Octopress a couple of weeks ago on Hacker News. Although Octopress
appealed to me on a technical level, in that it matched what I was
already doing, having blog posts as files on disk, what really got me
excited was the design of the default theme.

The default theme has a wonderful property: it flows. If you are using a
full screen browser, try making the window narrower. First, the sidebar
will be repositioned to the bottom. Then, if you make it even narrower,
the top navigation will collapse into a pulldown navigation menu. This
technique allows the same layout to look beautiful on a range of
devices, from a PC down to a smartphone. The theme alone made me want to
switch my blog to Octopress.

As developers, we appreciate good design. We also tend to suck at it.
When an open source project comes along with good design, it sticks out
from the crowd. So if you are looking to boost your open source project,
team up with a designer.

    </author>
    <content type="html">Last Friday, March 11th, there was a [9.0 earthquake in Northern
Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Sendai_earthquake_and_tsunami).
Despite Tokyo being several hundred kilometers from the epicenter, it's
effects were felt even here (although to a much lesser extent than in
Northern Japan). As someone who is interested in technology, over the
last five days, I've collected the following observations about how
technology as it relates to the quake.

### Early Warning Systems

As in Japan earthquakes are a part of normal life, the country is
designed to handle them. Beyond the buildings themselves being built to
withstand quakes, there is an [early warning system for
earthquakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_Early_Warning_(Japan)).
When an earthquake is detected, there are warnings broadcast on
televisions and even to mobile phones. However, although my mobile has
received many warnings of earthquakes since the initial one, I never got
a warning for the big one itself. Apparently the quake was [detected by
the early warning system and broadcast to
TV](http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Alert%20sounded%20minute%20before%20tremor%20struck/4425621/story.html),
so I'm not sure why I didn't receive one.

### Communications

Soon after the quake, everyone tried to reach out to loved ones on their
mobile phones. This brought down the cellular network, making it
virtually impossible to get in contact via mobile until Saturday
morning. As many people now only have mobile devices, long line-ups
formed at payphones.

Despite the troubles of the cellular network, the Internet functioned
perfectly. Knowing the news of this quake would soon reach my family in
Canada, I preemptively sent them an email informing them of the quake
and that I was alright. Soon after, I received a Skype call from my
parents, and since then have talked daily with them by it.

### Television

I don't have a television at home, but I do in my pocket. Though I
rarely use it, like many Japanese mobiles, my phone comes equipped with
[1seg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1seg), which allows me to watch TV
on my phone. As I walked home from the office after the quake, I saw
many people watching the events unfold on their mobile device. The
portable nature of a mobile phone, plus the battery, make it superior
device to a normal television in an emergency.

As watching television on your phone isn't the best viewing experience,
I've instead turned to the Internet. The major Japanese networks are
using Ustream, which was already quite popular in Japan, to stream live
broadcasts. NHK World has been [broadcasting in
English](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nhk-world-tv), but although they
cover press conferences live with translation, the overall focus is more
of an international nature. For up to date news, I turn directly to the
Japanese channels. Although my Japanese isn't so good, the news they
present is targeted at people living within Japan.

The overall demeanor of Japanese media is in line with that of the
general population - cool and calm. This is in stark contrast to
international media which seems overly sensationalistic.

### Social Networks

For timely information, Twitter has been my number one source. As it is
a real time information\
source, it's let me stay up to date with the situation of other people
around Tokyo.\
One specific example where it was useful was when I [mentioned that gas
at my apartment was
out](http://twitter.com/pwim/status/46138040816635904). Immediately, I
received [a
reply](http://twitter.com/kylebarrow/status/46162217414041601) that I
needed to press the reset button on the meter. In yet another example of
earthquake preparedness, the gas meters in Japan are designed to
automatically shut off in the event of a large earthquake. By [pressing
the button and
waiting](http://kabu-fx-news.seesaa.net/article/190095556.html), as long
as no leak is detected, normal operation resumes. If not for making this
aside comment on Twitter, I would have been without hot water and home
cooked food for at least a couple days, as I would have assumed the
outage was normal.

As Facebook isn't as real time as Twitter, I haven't found it so useful
for staying up to date. It does help me communicate with friends in
Japan who don't use twitter (such as one who had the same gas issue as
me - unfortunately she waited a day before posting anything and thus
went much longer without it) and family and friends abroad.

### Geiger Counters

Amongst the fears over the Fukushima reactor, many people have set up
Geiger counters and put the output up online. Some have the counter
[connected directly to the
computer](http://www.denphone.com/denphone-tokyo-office-geiger-counter),
others are [putting its display on
Ustream](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/geiger-counter-tokyo), and others
still [manually updating the
data](http://www.aist.go.jp/taisaku/ja/measurement/). Although some have
detected spikes of several times the normal levels of radiation, none
have detected anything even approaching harmful levels.

I think the biggest danger from this incident is not some giant death
cloud of radiation enveloping Tokyo, but rather from irradiated food or
water getting into the system undetected. I hope individuals like the
ones doing this already are enough to make the government and companies
ensure this does not happen.

### Electricity

Nuclear power and it's safety have been discussed extensively by people
far more qualified than myself to understand it, and as such leave it's
merits and risks to others. However, no matter the eventual outcome of
the situation, it will have a profound effect on Japan. There are
[seventeen power plants around
Japan](http://www.japannuclear.com/nuclearpower/program/location.html),
and the acceptance of them will no doubt be questioned by the
communities living near them.

Japan already has an electricity shortage. Before the quake, Japan was
excessively using power on stuff like neon signs, vending machines that
talk to you, and pachinko parlours. However, even though this waste has
been cut back, and many companies and factories have yet to resume
normal operations, there are still scheduled blackouts throughout Tokyo
and the surrounding areas. Dealing with this reduced capacity,
especially as the crisis subsides and people want to resume their normal
lives, will be perhaps Japan's biggest challenge.

[Tokyo Ruby Kaigi 05](http://regional.rubykaigi.org/tokyo05), a
[regional Ruby Kaigi](http://regional.rubykaigi.org/), was held last
night at EC Navi's company bar Ajito in Shibuya. Ajito is a popular
place to hold tech events, in no small part because they have a fridge
full of free drinks, and I was just there last week for
[ITEigo](http://groups.google.co.jp/group/iteigo). This Ruby Kaigi
emphasized communication, and as such, there wasn't traditional
presentations.

The event openned with Masayoshi Takahashi leading a discussion about
the *fun ruby,* which is also the subject of his book, [たのしいRuby](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4797357401?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mobalean-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4797357401),
for which he has just released a revised edition. In contrast with the
[Takahashi method
presentations](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/09/living_large_ta.html)
he is famous for, this time Takahashi only had a whiteboard to back him
up. Instead of lecturing the audience, he solicited everyone to
contribute what they found fun about ruby. ![Session](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTQ4OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--47bb0f033a790737b58da7d468eff63b178f91e3/tokyorubykaigi_session.jpg)

After the discussion led by Takahashi, the kaigi broke into smaller
discussion groups.

The first group I participated in was about Rails. People in the group
had applications that were running Rails 1.X through 3.0. We discussed
different deployment solutions, and
[Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) seemed to be the most popular
solution.

The theme of the second group was testing, and for some reason I ended
up leading the discussion despite my broken Japanese. Of the eight or so
people in the group, all but one or two used Rspec. When writing specs,
they used Japanese sentences, which causes some issues with readability
(because of the difference in sentence order between Japanese and
English). I introduced some of the testing libraries I use, such as
[shoulda](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda) and
[factory\_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl). During the
wrap up, when each table presented to the rest of the kaigi what had
been discussed, I was cajoled into doing the summary.

I really enjoyed the participatory nature of this event, and thanks to
the organizers for putting it on!

    <title>Facebook is Japan's LinkedIn</title>

    <content type="html">A couple of weeks back, an article [Facebook Wins Relatively Few Friends in Japan](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/technology/10facebook.html?pagewanted=all)
made its rounds. As usual, Facebook is compared to the big three
Japanese SNS: mixi, Gree, and Mobage-town. However, Gree and Mobage-town
market themselves more as social gaming platforms, where the focus is
the games themselves. On the other hand, mixi promotes itself as a way
of sharing photos, status updates, on so on.

While mixi is similar to Facebook from a feature perspective, the nature
of its social graph make it a fundamentally different beast. Unlike
Facebook, it provides facilities to search based on profile criteria
such as sex, age, and location, in combination with keywords. Mixi users
can also join *Communities* like お風呂ダイエット (bath diet) and
水樹奈々 ([Nana Mizuki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_Mizuki)), and
participate in BBS style discussions. These features make it easy for
users to form *virtual friendships*. At the same time, other users
restrict their mixi friends to only the closest of real world friends.

mixi's appeal stems from it offering control over who your friends are.
When mixi introduced a new feature allowing users to find each other by
email address, there was a strong backlash, resulting in [mixi
abandoning the
feature](http://asiajin.com/blog/2010/12/02/mixi-gives-up-new-search-friends-by-e-mail-address-feature-after-harsh-rejection/).
The ability to have anonymous profiles is key to this.

Facebook requires users to use their real name. This takes away control
over friendships from users. Though the system doesn't explicitly force
people to accept friendship requests, rejecting a boss or co-worker's
unwanted request is not something that is easy for a Japanese person to
do (or perhaps anyone for that manner). This lack of control means
Japanese users won't use Facebook in the same personal way as they use
mixi.

Instead of overtaking mixi in the *friendship* space, I think Facebook
is poised to become the leader in the *professional* space. Because
Japanese users don't view Facebook as being intimate, they don't use it
in a highly personal manner. Most Japanese I see using it don't share
anymore than they with casual acquaintances. As such, the overall
atmosphere of Japanese Facebook is already more professional than the
English Facebook.

Last night I attended [a networking
event](http://blog.livedoor.jp/nulab_hashimoto/archives/51740190.html)
with many of Tokyo's connected web developers and designers. As is
typical of such events, I received many business cards. Being a digital
person, I don't like the idea of needing to hold onto business cards.
There are a number of services for digitizing business cards, but then I
have a digital business card that is as dead as the paper one. I usually
try and find people on LinkedIn after such an event, but not so many
Japanese people use it. This time I decided to try Facebook instead. I
found seventeen out eighteen people. Now given the nature of the crowd,
perhaps that's not so surprising, but it caused me to dig a bit more.

I went back and tried to find everyone I found on Facebook on LinkedIn.
Of the eighteen, eight also had a LinkedIn account. However, the number
of LinkedIn connections tended to be much lower than Facebook friends.
Below is a graph of the Facebook friends and connections of the people I
met (excluding one outlier who had 2,097 Facebook friends but only 1
LinkedIn connection). ![Chart](https://www.tokyodev.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTQ4NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fc740b3dde354672f4ef916e2d2da1f5e0138a75/facebook_linkedin.png)

The sheer volume of Facebook friends these people have stand in stark
contrast to [a
report](http://www.tnsglobal.com/news/news-ED8B37EB4E6D4FE7BF125277F8E4C3EB.aspx)
last year that indicated Japanese, at an average of 29 friends on social
networks, have the least in the world. Furthermore, in addition to their
name, half of them listed a university they studied at, and two thirds
listed their current employer.

Facebook itself tried to push the professional SNS aspect in Japan last
year when it [teamed up with
Recruit](http://asiajin.com/blog/2010/10/01/connection-search-facebook-japan-and-recruit-launch-job-service-for-college-grads/)
to promote [Facebook as a way to find jobs](https://job.rikunabi.com/2012/contents/article/?themeName=facebook&amp;contents=index&amp;menu=U&amp;isc=r1rm00001305).
There is already at least one Japanese book on [using Facebook for business](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4478015147?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mobalean-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4478015147).

Facebook has yet to be a runaway success in Japan, but I think we are on
the tipping point for it to become the professional SNS.

[Venture Cafe] had its first event, はたらくモチベーション (Motivation
to Work), last night. The event consisted of a panel discussion followed
by a [World Cafe] style discussion.

The panel consisted of Yasuo Higa, the "chief-commiter" of the [Seasar]
project, [Masanori Hashimoto], the president of [nulab], and Hiroyuki
Yamaoka, an engineer at Zynga Japan.

Hashimoto's introduction was the most interesting. His company, who
makes [Cacoo], is one of the few examples I know of where a Japanese web
service is succeeding abroad. In his introduction, he talked about how
his motivation has fluctuated over the years. Starting with his first
job as a bartender at 18 (even though the legal drinking age is 20 in
Japan), he had relatively high motivation. When he joined his family's
company at age 20, he found his motivation dropping. Since then it has
fluctuated up and down, but it wasn't until his company was successfully
selling its own products that he found his motivation exceeded that of
his original bartending job.

After the panel, for the "World Cafe" style discussion, my table was
hosted by a university student. The other members were another
university student and the director of an incubation company. I found
this to be a great opportunity to practice Japanese, and I'm really
thankful to everyone who had patience with me and encouraged me to
participate.

One thing I liked about the event was that their were many University
students participating. I guess I've gotten used to being the young one
in the room, so it was pretty refreshing for me. One student had come
all the way from Kyoto for the event, and said she was spending the
night at a net cafe in Tokyo. I was impressed by the students that came
to the event, and hope start seeing more students at other events.

The nijikai was held at Ginza lion. I enjoyed continuing chatting with
the participants over a couple beers, but when the bill was ¥4000 (in
addition to the ¥3000 for the event), it came out to being a rather
expensive outing. Nevertheless, I found this to be one of the best
events I've been to here in Tokyo, so I'm looking forward to the next
one.

Last night's [Tokyo Rubyist Meetup] had over forty guests, about half of
which were Japanese. I was happy to see that Japanese and non-Japanese
alike mixed with each other, and I think pretty much everyone had a good
time.

The event was hosted by [Cookpad], who run Japan's largest Ruby on Rails
site and is [looking for developers]. The company has the nicest office
of any Japanese company I've ever been to, and if I was looking for a
job, I'd certainly consider applying there.

This time, I asked [Akira Matsuda] to give an encore of his presentation
[Ruby in the World, and Rails in Japan] that he presented at Ruby World
Conference 2010, as the theme matched that of Tokyo Rubyist Meetup. In
his presentation, he talked about Japanese rubyists being too reliant on
translations of Rails material. The problem with translations, he said,
was that there is a great delay between when the original material is
released, and when the translation is finished. As an example, the book
[Head First Rails], which he translated, was finally released two years
after the original edition. Furthermore, translation is a one way
street, and rubyists reliant on translated materials cannot engage the

At the end of his presentation, Akira asked the audience what we can do
to close the gap in communication between Japanese and non-Japanese
rubyists. One suggestion was to get rid of the two core mailing lists,
and allow both Japanese and English communication to continue on a
single list. Another was that when responding to change requests that
have already been disscused in Japanese, the previous conversation
should be linked to, so that non-Japanese rubyists have a place to start
(for instance, using machine translation).

Unfortunately, the conversation after Akira's presentation was dominated
by non-Japanese. I can certainly understand not wanting to participate
in a group discussion in a language you aren't comfortable speaking - I
have that problem with Japanese. However, as the rest of the night had a
lot of participation from both sides, this one hiccup was pretty minor.

After the meetup, I went out for a nijikai with about ten other
rubyists. I managed to make my last train, but I think the rest of them
weren't able too. I didn't want to go back home, but as I had a morning
meeting, staying out all night seemed like not the best thing to do.

I had a great time meeting up with all my fellow rubyists here in Tokyo,
and am eagerly awaiting the next event.

Hiroshi Mikitani started [Rakuten's Technology Conference] in English,
but quickly switched to Japanese. He claimed there was a strong demand
from the Japanese participants for him to present in Japanese. This
shows how much work ahead of him he has if Rakuten is going to meet the
company's goal of [adopting English as their official language in 2012].

Mikitani's speech talked about how Japan's market share will decrease
over the next 50 years, and for Japan to survive it will have to adapt
itself to the global marketplace. In particular, it is important for
engineers to use English, and not rely on translations, he said, for
besides Japan, English is the common language of engineers.

Despite this English emphasis, the conference was almost entirely in
Japanese. Not even window dressing attempts at English like its policy
that [menus and elevator signs must be written in English] were applied
to the conference's signage. For instance, the conference was entitled
"楽天テクノロジーカンファレンス2010" instead of the equally
understandable by all Japanese "Rakuten Technology Conference 2010". Had
Rakuten held this conference in English, it would have been a great
chance for them to lead by example, and show Engineers that even as a
Japanese speaking to another Japanese, you can use English.

One session I attended was conducted in English, despite requests
otherwise, by Hirotaka Yoshioka. Despite its positive beginnings, I was
disappointed by the revelations of PriceMinister's CTO Justin Ziegler
and tarad.com's founder Pawoot Pongvitayapanu's about how their
companies changed "for the better" since being acquired by Rakuten.
Zeigler decried France's labour laws, and how they meant employees don't
work the long hours that their Japanese counterparts do. Pongvitayapanu
explained that Thailand has a laid-back culture, and since joining
Rakuten, he was impressed that all his employees assembled for Rakuten's
morning meeting at 5:30am before he did. If long hours and meetings are
the best of Rakuten, they have a long way to go.

Overall, Rakuten is trying to become a global corporation just by
changing their language to English. But if the company culture doesn't
change as well, English is just window dressing.

    <content type="html">Today I attended [the second Asiajin meetup]. Asiajin is an English
language blog that covers what is going on in the Japanese internet
space. About 20 people participated, with over half the attendees being
Japanese. This surprised me, as the blog's target is English speakers, I
thought more of the attendees would be non-Japanese.

[Akky Akimoto], the co-founder of Asiajin, started the event with a
presentation discussing the state of Asiajin. He revealed the site has
around 6000 subscribers, who are distributed around the world. The top
two countries for visitors are Japan (about 15) and America (about 10).
He also stated that although Asiajin is a hobby blog, they are looking
for sponsors. They have been going after Japanese companies looking to
expand their presence internationally, but so far have had little
success.

Akky's presentation was followed by [Yosuke Akamatsu] presenting about
his mobile video broadcasting app [Twitcasting]. Unlike other video
broadcasting services, Twitcasting only allows for mobile to mobile
broadcasting. Because of this, the service performs much better on
mobile than his competitors. The app has experienced the most success in
Japan, where they have 10% market share of all user video broadcasting
services (this includes PC traffic for the other services). So far the
app hasn't been so successful in America. The American version includes
advertising through the iAd platform, but although there is a good
clickthrough rate, the revenue isn't enough to cover the costs. Future
ideas for monetization include licensing a video broadcasting SDK and
creating more content based apps. Yosuke ended his presentation with a
cool demo where he strapped an iPhone to an RC car and used his app's
broadcasting capability to control the RC car while using an iPad to
navigate.

After Yosuke's presentation, Akky gave another presentation, this time
about SNS in Japan. He talked about how despite Japanese SNS having
small size compared to Facebook, they have a much higher ARPU. Of the
three main Japanese SNS, mixi, mobage town, and gree, only mixi follows
the Facebook model. The other two are more like social gaming platforms,
and also produce their own content. We had a discussion about what
really constitutes a SNS, and are mobage and gree really SNS. Although
we didn't really reach any conclusion, the discussion was enjoyable.

After the event officially ended, most of the participants headed out
together for food and drinks where we continued a lively discussion.
Overall, the small size and quality of attendees made the event quite
enjoyable to me, and I look forward to the next event.
