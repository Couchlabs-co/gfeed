&lt;p&gt;Many software teams create services exposed as APIs, designed to be
     consumed by other software and thus without any user-interface. Such
     services are hard to demonstrate, as they effectively just dump pages of
     JSON. A &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/demo-front-end.html'&gt;demo front-end&lt;/a&gt; is a simple user-interface just used to
     manipulate such an API. &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Matteo Vaccari&lt;/b&gt; describes how and
     why to build one - showing its usefulness both in explaining the
     API's capabilities to stakeholders and to help client developers explore

&lt;p&gt;Here is a new article in the bottlenecks of scaleups series, looking at
     resilience and observability. Startups tend to only address resilience when
     their systems are already down, often taking a very reactive approach. For
     a scaleup, &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/05-resilience-and-observability.html'&gt;excessive system downtime represents a significant
     bottleneck&lt;/a&gt; to the organization, both from the effort expended on
     restoring function and also from the impact of customer dissatisfaction.
     &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Punit Lad&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Carl Nygard&lt;/b&gt; explain that to
     move past this, resilience needs to be built into the business objectives,
     which will influence the architecture, design, product management, and even
     governance of business systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any business that wants to grow needs to be built on strong and stable

&lt;p&gt;My colleague &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Sarah Taraporewalla&lt;/b&gt; describes an approach
     to building technology strategy that challenges the convention. It starts
     by identifying the overall strategic directions that the organization is
     considering, and using common aspects of these directions to indicate the
     investigations needed for the organization to understand the technology
     implications raised by that strategic change. &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/creating-integrated-tech-strategy.html'&gt;This first
     installment&lt;/a&gt; looks at two of these directions: expanding the business
     by creating complementary products, and expanding the business into new
     markets and regions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;div class="book-sidebar no-text"&gt;&lt;span class="img-link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1942788819/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1942788819&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20"&gt;&lt;img class="cover" src="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/team-topologies/book.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any large software effort, such as the software estate for a large
    company, requires a lot of people - and whenever you have a lot of people
    you have to figure out how to divide them into effective teams. Forming
    &lt;a href="/bliki/BusinessCapabilityCentric.html"&gt;Business Capability Centric&lt;/a&gt; teams helps software efforts to
    be responsive to customersâ€™ needs, but the range of skills required often
    overwhelms such teams. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1942788819/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1942788819&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20"&gt;Team Topologies&lt;/a&gt; is a model
    for describing the organization of software development teams,
    developed by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. It defines four forms
    of teams and three modes of team
    interactions. The model encourages healthy interactions that allow 
    business-capability centric teams to flourish in their task of providing a
    steady flow of valuable software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary kind of team in this framework is the &lt;b&gt;stream-aligned
    team&lt;/b&gt;, a &lt;a href="/bliki/BusinessCapabilityCentric.html"&gt;Business Capability Centric&lt;/a&gt; team that is
    responsible for software for a single business capability. These are
    long-running teams, thinking of their efforts as providing a &lt;a href="/articles/products-over-projects.html"&gt;software
    product&lt;/a&gt; to enhance the business capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each stream-aligned team is full-stack and full-lifecycle: responsible for
    front-end, back-end, database,
    business analysis, feature prioritization,
    UX, testing, deployment, monitoring - the
    whole enchilada of software development.
    They are &lt;a href="/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html"&gt;Outcome Oriented&lt;/a&gt;, focused on business outcomes rather than &lt;a href="/bliki/ActivityOriented.html"&gt;Activity Oriented&lt;/a&gt; teams focused on a function such as business
    analysis, testing, or databases.
    But they also shouldn't be too
    large, ideally each one is a &lt;a href="/bliki/TwoPizzaTeam.html"&gt;Two Pizza Team&lt;/a&gt;. A large
    organization will have many such teams, and while they have different
    business capabilities to support, they have common needs such as data
    storage, network communications, and observability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small team like this calls for ways to reduce their cognitive load, so they
    can concentrate on supporting the business needs, not on (for example) data
    storage issues. An important part of doing this is to build on a platform
    that takes care of these non-focal concerns. For many teams a platform can
    be a widely available third party platform, such as Ruby on Rails for a
    database-backed web application. But for many products there is no
    single off-the-shelf platform to use, a team is going to have to find and
    integrate several platforms. In a larger organization they will have to
    access a range of internal services and follow corporate standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem can be addressed by building an internal platform for the
    organization. Such a platform can do that integration of third-party
    services, near-complete platforms, and internal services. Team Topologies
    classifies the team that builds this (unimaginatively-but-wisely) as a &lt;b&gt;platform
    team&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller organizations can work with a single platform team, which
    produces a thin layer over an externally provided set of products. Larger
    platforms, however, require more people than can be fed with two-pizzas.
    The authors are thus moving to describe a &lt;b&gt;platform grouping&lt;/b&gt;
    of many platform teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important characteristic of a platform is that it's designed to be used
    in a mostly self-service fashion. The stream-aligned teams are still
    responsible for the operation of their product, and direct their use of the
    platform without expecting an elaborate collaboration with the platform team.
    In the Team Topologies framework, this interaction mode is referred to as
    &lt;b&gt;X-as-a-Service mode&lt;/b&gt;, with the platform acting as a service to the
    stream-aligned teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platform teams, however, need to build their services as products
    themselves, with a deep understanding of their customer's needs. This often
    requires that they use a different interaction mode, one of &lt;b&gt;collaboration
    mode&lt;/b&gt;, while they build that service. Collaboration mode is a more
    intensive partnership form of interaction, and should be seen as a temporary
    approach until the platform is mature enough to move to x-as-a service
    mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the model doesn't represent anything particularly inventive.
    Breaking organizations down between business-aligned and technology support
    teams is an approach as old as enterprise software. In recent years, plenty
    of writers have expressed the importance of making these business capability
    teams be responsible for the full-stack and the full-lifecycle. For me, the
    bright insight of Team Topologies is focusing on the problem that having
    business-aligned teams that are full-stack and full-lifecycle means that
    they are often faced with an excessive cognitive load, which works against
    the desire for small, responsive teams. The key benefit of a
    platform is that it &lt;i&gt;reduces this cognitive load&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="soundbyte" style="padding-left: 5em; font-style: italic"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crucial insight of Team Topologies is that the primary benefit of a
    platform is to reduce the cognitive load on stream-aligned
    teams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This insight has profound implications. For a start it alters how
    platform teams should think about the platform. Reducing client teams'
    cognitive load leads to different design decisions and product roadmap to
    platforms intended primarily for standardization or cost-reduction. 
    Beyond the platform this insight leads Team Topologies to develop their model
    further by identifying two more kinds of team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some capabilities require specialists who can put considerable time and
    energy into mastering a topic important to many stream-aligned teams. A
    security specialist may spend more time studying security issues and
    interacting with the broader security community than would be possible as a
    member of a stream-aligned team. Such people congregate in &lt;b&gt;enabling
    teams&lt;/b&gt;, whose role is to grow relevant skills inside other teams
    so that those teams can remain independent and better own and evolve their
    services.
    To achieve this enabling teams primarily use the third and final interaction
    mode in Team Topologies. &lt;b&gt;Facilitating mode&lt;/b&gt;
    involves a coaching role, where the enabling team isn't there to write and
    ensure conformance to standards, but instead to educate and coach their colleagues so
    that the stream-aligned teams become more autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stream-aligned teams are responsible for the whole stream of value for their
    customers, but occasionally we find aspects of a stream-aligned team's work
    that is sufficiently demanding that it needs a dedicated group to focus on
    it, leading to the fourth and final type of team:
    &lt;b&gt;complicated-subsystem team&lt;/b&gt;. The goal of a complicated-subsystem
    team is to reduce the cognitive load of the stream-aligned teams that use
    that complicated subsystem. That's a worthwhile division even if there's
    only one client team for that subsystem. Mostly complicated-subsystem teams strive to interact
    with their clients using x-as-a service mode, but will need to
    use collaboration mode for short periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure "&gt;&lt;img src="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/team-topologies/diagram.png"&gt;
&lt;p class="photoCaption"&gt;
      Team Topologies includes a set of graphical symbols to illustrate teams
      and their relationships. These shown here are from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/TeamTopologies/Team-Shape-Templates"&gt;current standards&lt;/a&gt;, which differ from those used in
      the book. A &lt;a href="https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts-content/team-interaction-modeling-with-team-topologies"&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; elaborates on
      how to use these diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team Topologies is designed explicitly recognizing the influence of
    &lt;a href="/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html"&gt;Conways Law&lt;/a&gt;. The team organization that it encourages
    takes into account the interplay between human and software organization.
    Advocates of Team Topologies intend its team structure to shape the future
    development of the software architecture into responsive and decoupled
    components aligned to business needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Box neatly quipped: "all models are wrong, some are useful". Thus
    Team Topologies is wrong: complex organizations cannot be
    simply broken down into just four kinds of teams and three kinds of
    interactions. But constraints like this are what makes a model useful. Team
    Topologies is a tool that impels people to evolve their organization into a more effective
    way of operating, one that allows stream-aligned teams to maximize their
    flow by lightening their cognitive load.

&lt;h2&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best treatment of the Team Topologies framework is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1942788819/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1942788819&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20"&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt; of the same name, published in 2019. The authors
      also maintain the &lt;a href="https://teamtopologies.com"&gt;Team Topologies&lt;/a&gt; website
      and provide education and training services. Their recent article on &lt;a href="https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts-content/team-interaction-modeling-with-team-topologies"&gt;team interaction modeling&lt;/a&gt; is a good intro to
      how the Team Topologies (meta-)model can be used to build and evolve a
      model of an organization. &lt;span class="foot-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#footnote-meta"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of Team Topologies is based on the notion of Cognitive Load. The
      authors &lt;a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/forget-monoliths-vs-microservices-cognitive-load-what-matters"&gt;explored cognitive load&lt;/a&gt; in Tech Beacon. Jo Pearce expanded on how
      cognitive load may &lt;a href="https://12devsofxmas.co.uk/2015/12/day-3-managing-cognitive-load-for-team-learning/"&gt;apply to software
      development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model in Team Topologies resonates well with much of the thinking
      on software team organization that I've published on this site. You can
      find this collected together at the &lt;a href="/tags/team%20organization.html"&gt;team
      organization tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-meta"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
    To be more strict in my modeling lingo, I would say that Team Topologies
    usually acts as a &lt;b&gt;meta-model&lt;/b&gt;. If I use Team Topologies to build
    a model of an airline's software development organization, then that model
    shows the teams in the airline classified according to Team Topologies's
    terminology. I would then say that that the Team Topologies model is a
    meta-model to my airline model.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bliki: TwoPizzaTeam</title>
    <link href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoPizzaTeam.html"/>
    <updated>2023-07-25T09:22:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoPizzaTeam.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;A two-pizza team is a small team
  that fully supports software for a particular business capability. The term
  became popular as it used to describe how Amazon organized their software staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name suggests the most obvious aspect of such teams, their size. The
  name comes from the principle that the team should no larger than can be fed
  with two pizzas. (Although we are talking about American Pizzas here, which
  seemed alarmingly huge when I first encountered them over here.) Keeping a
  team small keeps it cohesive, forming tight working relationships. Typically I
  hear this means such teams are about 5-8 people, although my experience
  suggests that the upper limit is somewhere about 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the name focuses solely on the size, just as important is the
  team's focus. A two-pizza team should have all the capabilities it needs to
  delivery valuable software to its users, with minimal hand-offs and
  dependencies on other teams. They can figure out what their customer needs,
  and quickly translate that into working software, able to experiment and
  evolve that software as their customer's needs change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-pizza teams are &lt;a href="/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html"&gt;Outcome Oriented&lt;/a&gt; rather than
  &lt;a href="/bliki/ActivityOriented.html"&gt;Activity Oriented&lt;/a&gt;. They don't organize along lines of skills
  (databases, testing, operations), instead they take on all the responsibilities
  required to support their customers. This minimizes inter-team hand-offs in the
  flow of features to their customers, allowing them to reduce the cycle-time
  (the time required to turn an idea for a feature into code running in
  production). This outcome-orientation also means they deploy code into
  production and monitor its use there, famously responsible for any production
  outages (often meaning they on the hook for off-hours support) - a principle
  known as "you build it, you run it".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on a customer need like this means teams are long-lived, &lt;a href="/bliki/BusinessCapabilityCentric.html"&gt;Business Capability Centric&lt;/a&gt; teams that support their business
  capability as long as that capability is active. Unlike project-oriented teams -
  that disband when the software is "done" - they think of themselves as
  enabling and enhancing a &lt;a href="/articles/products-over-projects.html"&gt;long-lived
  product&lt;/a&gt;. This aspect often leads to them being referred to as &lt;b&gt;product
  teams&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wide scope of skills and responsibilities that a two-pizza team needs
  to support its product means that although such teams can be the primary
  approach to team organization, they need support from a well-constructed
  software platform. For small organizations, this can be a commercial platform,
  such as a modern cloud offering. Larger organizations will create their own
  internal platforms to make it easier for their two-pizza teams to collaborate
  without creating difficult hand-offs. &lt;a href="/bliki/TeamTopologies.html"&gt;Team Topologies&lt;/a&gt;
  provides a good way to think about the different kinds of teams and
  interactions required to support two-pizza teams (Team Topologies calls them
  &lt;b&gt;stream-aligned teams&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For business-capability centric teams to be effective, they will need to
  make use of each others' capabilities. Teams will thus need to provide their
  capabilities to their peers, often though thoughtfully designed APIs. This
  responsibility for such teams to provide services to their peers is often
  overlooked, if it doesn't happen it will lead to sclerotic information
  silos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizing people around business capabilities like this has a profound
  interaction with the way the software for an organization is structured - due
  to the effect of &lt;a href="/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html"&gt;Conways Law&lt;/a&gt;. Software components built by
  two-pizza teams need well-controlled interactions with their peers, with clear
  APIs between them. This thinking led to the development of &lt;a href="/microservices/"&gt;microservices&lt;/a&gt;, but that's not the only approach -
  well-structured components within a monolithic run-time is often a better
  path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platform teams have a unique reliance on other teams to ensure adoption
     of their platform - getting code changes into other teams' codebase is
     critical to their success. &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Pete Hodgson&lt;/b&gt; structures how
     &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/platform-teams-stuff-done.html'&gt;platform teams collaborate&lt;/a&gt; into phases
     of migration, consumption, and evolution. He describes what's different in
     each of these phases, the operating models to adopt, and which cross-team
     collaboration patterns work best.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;It's common to see a centralized architecture function that sets
     standards and oversees development projects. Such teams often suffer from
     being far removed from the issues of implementation with long
     feedback loops that slow down the flow of work. To counter these problems,
     many organizations have explored a decentralized approach to yield
     alignment between teams without these problems. One such organization is
     Xapo bank, &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/xapo-architecture-experience.html'&gt;which did this&lt;/a&gt; using ideas taken from Domain-Driven Design, Team
     Topologies, and the Architectural Advice Process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it's fascinating to work directly with a Large Language Model,
     such as ChatGPT, it takes some skill and practice to learn how to prompt it
     effectively. My colleague &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Farooq Ali&lt;/b&gt; has been working on a co-pilot tool,
     Boba AI, for using an LLM to help generate ideas for product strategy. From
     this experience he as &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/building-boba.html'&gt;proposed eight patterns&lt;/a&gt; which he judges
     will be generally useful for building these kinds of AI co-pilot applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile applications often deliver features rapidly at first, but slow as
     a codebase builds up. These common software problems are exacerbated by the
     need to prioritize different features in different markets. &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Matthew
     Foster&lt;/b&gt; describes an example of this from his work with clients,
     and how using Domain-Driven Design and Team Topologies helped &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/linking-modular-arch.html'&gt;create a
     modular architecture&lt;/a&gt; that substantially reduced the time needed to deliver
     new features. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Privacy Enhancing Technologies: An Introduction for Technologists</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Making data open and available to all helps us all understand our world
     and are thus better informed to shape the policies to run it. But such openness
     does come with problems - one in particular is the invasion of people's
     privacy. Detailed census information about household income helps debate
     and planning for local government, but can reveal personal information that
     citizens reasonably prefer to keep private. &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/intro-pet.html'&gt;Privacy Enhancing Technologies&lt;/a&gt;
     are tools that can finesse this problem. My colleague &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Katharine Jarmul&lt;/b&gt; is a
     data scientist who is also an activist for personal privacy. Here she
     introduces three of these tools that are usable now: Differential Privacy,
     Distributed &amp;amp; Federated Analysis &amp;amp; Learning, and Encrypted Computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers commonly ask "what framework should we use for dependency
     injection". &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Daniel Somerfield&lt;/b&gt; explains why this is the wrong question,
     instead we should focus how to have clearly separated modules with a simple
     composition mechanism between them. &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/dependency-composition.html'&gt;He illustrates&lt;/a&gt; how he approaches this
     in TypeScript, with a minimalist "function-first" approach, on a simple
     example application separating application logic from persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
