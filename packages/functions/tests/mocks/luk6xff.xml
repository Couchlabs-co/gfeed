                        <span></span>
                        <span>I was very motivated to create markdown stuff. </span>
                        <span></span>

                <pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh ">
                    <code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">
                        <span>cargo install mdbook </span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Then, navigate to your book directory and run:</p>
                <pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh ">
                    <code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">
                        <span>mdbook build </span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>This command compiles your Markdown files into a static website that you can host or view locally.</p>
                <h3 id="step-5-final-step-viewing-your-book">Step 5: Final Step: Viewing Your Book</h3>
                <p>After building, you can view your book by opening the index.html file in the book directory with a web browser, or you can serve it locally with:</p>
                <pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh ">
                    <code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">
                        <span>mdbook serve </span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>This command starts a local web server. You can view your book by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.</p>

                <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
                <p>Have you ever felt overwhelmed by a busy schedule? This blog post explores the creation of a simple Time Planner app, developed in just a few hours to meet my wife's needs for organizing her time spent on tasks. It utilizes Python's powerful GUI framework, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/">PySide6</a>, to achieve this.</p>
                <h3 id="source-code-and-build-instructions">Source Code and Build Instructions</h3>
                <p>The repository is, as always, available on <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/luk6xff/TimePlanner">my GitHub</a>.
                </p>
                <h3 id="pyside6-in-action">PySide6 in Action</h3>
                <p>PySide6 is the official Python module from the Qt for Python project, offering access to the complete Qt 6.0+ framework and excelling in creating user-friendly interfaces. Here's how it enhances the TimePlanner:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Intuitive Layouts:</strong> PySide6's widgets and layout managers facilitate the creation of a clear and organized interface, with task lists, scheduling components, and priority indicators neatly arranged for easy interaction.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Seamless User Interaction:</strong> Featuring buttons, text boxes, and other interactive elements, it enables users to add, edit, or mark tasks as complete effortlessly.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> One of its major advantages is ensuring that the app runs smoothly on both Windows and Linux, providing flexibility for users on different operating systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="development-process">Development Process</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Conceptualization:</strong> The goal was to develop an app that allows users to add tasks to a daily list, store them, and start counting the time spent on a selected task upon clicking it.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Environment Setup:</strong> The setup involves installing Python, PySide6, Pillow, and PyInstaller libraries. The development was primarily focused on Windows, as that's my wife's main operating system. To set up, simply run the following commands:<pre data-lang="ps1" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-ps1 ">
                        <code class="language-ps1" data-lang="ps1">
                            <span>.\setup.ps1 </span>
                            <span>.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 </span>
                            <span>pip install -r requirements.txt </span>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>GUI Design:</strong> The UI was entirely crafted manually, without the use of the Qt Designer tool, in the method <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/luk6xff/TimePlanner/blob/master/main.py#L60">
                    <code>init_ui</code>
                </a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Functionality Implementation:</strong> The rest of the logic is straightforwardly implemented as part of the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/luk6xff/TimePlanner/blob/master/main.py#L25">
                <code>TimePlanner</code>
            </a> class, which inherits from <code>QWidget</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Storage:</strong> The history of tasks is stored in a <code>json</code> file named <code>tasks.json</code> in the root folder of your script or executable file.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Local App Build:</strong> To build the app locally, simply run:<pre data-lang="ps1" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-ps1 ">
            <code class="language-ps1" data-lang="ps1">
                <span>.\run.ps1 </span>
            </code>
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Standalone Executable Deployment:</strong> A statically linked PE executable can be created using the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/">PyInstaller tool</a> by running the <code>.\deploy.ps1</code> command.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="benefits-and-impact">Benefits and Impact</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Organization:</strong> Tasks are clearly listed, prioritized, and easily accessible, fostering better focus and reducing mental clutter.</li>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Notifications:</strong> Using PySide6 to implement reminders or alerts for upcoming tasks or deadlines, ensuring important tasks are not overlooked.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Collaboration Features:</strong> Potential for shared task lists or calendars, facilitating teamwork and project management.</li>
    <li>

<h2 id="a-quick-guide-to-using-gef-for-debugging">A Quick Guide to Using GEF for Debugging</h2>
<p>Debugging is like being a detective for software, where you hunt for clues to fix problems in code. GEF makes this detective work easier and more effective, especially when you're dealing with tricky bugs or trying to understand how a program really works. Let's break down how GEF can help you and how to get started with it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-gef">What is GEF?</h2>
<p>GEF is a tool that adds extra powers to GDB, the GNU Debugger, which is a tool many developers use to find bugs in their programs. GEF makes GDB more user-friendly and powerful by adding new features, such as better visuals, more information about your program's status, and tools to check the security of your software.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-use-gef">Why Should You Use GEF?</h2>
<p>GEF makes your life easier when you're debugging:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Clearer Information</strong>: It shows you what's going on in your program more clearly, making it easier to understand problems.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Better Control</strong>: You get more ways to stop and inspect your program exactly where and when you need to.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Find Bugs Faster</strong>: GEF has special features to help spot common mistakes that can lead to bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-gef">Getting Started with GEF</h2>
<h3 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h3>
<p>First, you need GDB installed. Then, to add GEF, you run a simple command in your terminal:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-bash ">
    <code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">
        <span>bash -c </span>
        <span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;$(</span>
        <span>curl -fsSL</span>
        <span style="color:#d69d85;"> http://gef.blah.cat/sh)&quot; </span>
    </code>
</pre>
<p>This command gets GEF set up with your GDB, and you're ready to go!</p>
<h3 id="using-gef">Using GEF</h3>
<p>To start debugging a program with GEF, you open your terminal and type:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-bash ">
    <code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">
        <span>gdb -q ./your_program </span>
    </code>
</pre>
<p>This command starts GDB like usual, but you'll notice GEF's improvements right away.</p>
<h3 id="helpful-features">Helpful Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>
            <code>context</code>
        </strong>: This shows a snapshot of what's happening in your program, like what the computer is currently working on and what data it's handling.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            <code>heap</code>
        </strong>: If your program uses dynamic memory (allocating memory during runtime), this command helps you see how that memory is being used or misused.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            <code>pattern create</code> /            <code>pattern search</code>
        </strong>: These commands help you figure out how data is laid out in memory, which is super useful for finding certain types of bugs.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            <code>checksec</code>
        </strong>: This command checks the security properties of your executable, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities, such as stack canaries or NX bits.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            <code>gef config / gef save</code>
        </strong>: Customize and save your GEF environment to streamline your debugging sessions, tailoring the tool to your needs.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            <code>dereference</code>
        </strong>: Offers a more intuitive view of pointers and memory addresses, making it easier to navigate through complex structures.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            <code>registers</code>
        </strong>: Get a quick overview of the current state of CPU registers, which is crucial for low-level debugging</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debugging-with-gef-a-quick-example">Debugging with GEF: A Quick Example</h3>
<p>Imagine you have a program that's not working right, and you suspect it's due to a bug where the program is trying to access memory it shouldn't. Here's how you might use GEF to find that bug:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Start GEF with your program</strong>:        <code>gdb -q ./buggy_program</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Set a breakpoint</strong>: This is like telling GEF, &quot;Pause here; I want to check something.&quot; You can do this with the command <code>break main</code> if you want to stop right when the main function starts.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Run the program</strong>: Just type <code>run</code> and hit enter. The program will start and then pause where you set the breakpoint.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step through the code</strong>: Use the <code>next</code> command to go through your program one line at a time. Watch the <code>context</code> information GEF gives you to see what the program is doing.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Inspect memory</strong>: If you think the bug is happening because the program is accessing memory it shouldn't, you can use commands like <code>x/gx</code>,        <code>heap chunks</code>, and <code>search-pattern</code> to explore and manipulate memory at runtime, helping uncover issues like memory leaks or corruption.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scripting</strong>: Automate repetitive analysis tasks or implement custom logic for complex debugging scenarios using Python scripts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Through this process, GEF gives you a clearer view of what's happening inside your program, helping you spot and fix the bug.</p>

    </code>
</pre>
<h4 id="step-6-step-through-the-code">Step 6: Step Through the Code</h4>
<p>Use the <code>next</code> or <code>n</code> command to step through the code line by line. If you want to step into functions (like <code>store_credentials_into_db</code>), use <code>step</code> or <code>s</code> instead.</p>
<h4 id="step-6-inspect-variables-and-memory">Step 6: Inspect Variables and Memory</h4>
<p>As you reach the <code>std::cin</code> call, you can inspect the contents of <code>buffer</code> and other variables:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you want to dereference all the stack entries inside a function context (on a 64bit architecture): <code>p ($rbp - $rsp)/8</code>
    </li>
    <li>Find the memory address of the <code>buffer</code> array: <code>p &amp;buffer[0]</code>= 0x7fffffffd7b0</li>
    <li>To examine the content of <code>buffer</code>:        <code>x/128c buffer</code>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-7-continue-execution">Step 7: Continue Execution</h4>
<p>After inspecting the variables at the first breakpoint, continue execution to see if the second breakpoint (<code>admin_panel</code>) is hit.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh ">
    <code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">
        <span>(gef) continue </span>
    </code>
</pre>
<h4 id="step-8-experiment-with-inputs">Step 8: Experiment with Inputs</h4>
<p>If you're analyzing the program for vulnerabilities, you might try inputs that could potentially overflow <code>buffer</code> or otherwise manipulate the program's flow. Run</p>
<h4 id="step-9-utilize-gef-commands-for-deeper-analysis">Step 9: Utilize GEF Commands for Deeper Analysis</h4>
<p>GEF provides commands that are particularly useful for security analysis:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>pattern create</code> and <code>pattern search</code> to test for buffer overflows.</li>
    <li>
        <code>heap bins</code> to inspect the heap state if dynamic memory allocation is used elsewhere in the program.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-10-quit-gef">Step 10: Quit GEF</h4>
<p>Once you're done debugging, you can quit GEF with the <code>quit</code> command.</p>

<h2 id="coding-with-platformio">Coding with PlatformIO</h2>
<p>While the project leverages the familiar Arduino environment for coding the logic, it utilizes PlatformIO as the development platform. PlatformIO is a powerful tool that offers a streamlined experience for working with various microcontroller boards, including the ESP32 used in this project. It integrates seamlessly with popular code editors like Visual Studio Code, making development and debugging more efficient.</p>
<p>The code itself handles everything from keeping time to controlling the display, talking to sensors (if you use them), and interacting with the web interface. This web interface lets you adjust things like time zones, weather app settings, and how the clock looks – all from your web browser.</p>
<h2 id="more-than-just-telling-time">More Than Just Telling Time</h2>
<p>This LED clock is packed with the folowing features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Automatic Time Updates:</strong> Never worry about setting the time again! The clock can sync up with the internet to stay perfectly accurate. It also supports timezones and time changes.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Current weather and forecasts:</strong> See the weather forecasts, nowcasts from <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://openweathermap.org/">openweathermap.org</a> on the display.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Weather station:</strong> See the current temperature, pressure or humidity (if you have the LORA sensor) right on your clock.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:</strong> Keep your clock's firmware up-to-date by uploading new versions wirelessly. This ensures you have the latest features and bug fixes without needing to physically reconnect the clock to your computer.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Web Tweaks:</strong> Change settings and customize how the clock looks using any web browser on your network.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Make it Yours:</strong> Play around with different display styles, animations, and brightness levels to personalize your clock.</li>
</ul>
