<h2 id="chapterxxxiiionsewingcuttingandmending">CHAPTER XXXIII. ON SEWING, CUTTING, AND MENDING.</h2>
<p>Every young girl should be taught to do the following kinds of stitch, with propriety. Over-stitch, hemming, running, felling, stitching, back-stitch and run, buttonhole-stitch, chain-stitch, whipping, darning, gathering, and cross-stitch.</p>
<p>\
In doing over-stitch, the edges should always be first fitted, either with pins or basting, to prevent puckering. In turning wide hems, a paper measure should be used, to make them even. Tucks, also, should be regulated by a paper measure. A fell should be turned, before the edges are put together, and the seam should be over-sewed, before felling. All biased or goring seams should be felled. For stitching, draw a thread, and take up two or three threads at a stitch.</p>
<p>\
In making buttonholes, it is best to have a pair of scissors, made for the purpose, which cut very neatly. For broadcloth, a chisel and board are better. The best stitch is made by putting in the needle, and then turning the thread around it, near the eye. This is better than to draw the needle through, and then take up a loop. A thread should first be put across each side of the buttonhole, and also a stay-thread, or bar, at each end, before working it. In working the buttonhole, keep the stay-thread as far from the edge as possible. A small bar should be worked at each end.&nbsp;Whipping is done better by sewing&nbsp;<em>over</em>, and not under. The roll should be as fine as possible, the stitches short, the thread strong, and in sewing, every gather should be taken up.</p>
<p>\
The rule for&nbsp;<em>gathering</em>, in shirts, is, to draw a thread, and then take up two threads and skip four. In&nbsp;<em>darning</em>, after the perpendicular threads are run, the crossing threads should interlace, exactly, taking one thread and leaving one, like woven threads.</p>
<p>\
The neatest sewers always fit and baste their work, before sewing; and they say they always save time in the end, by so doing, as they never have to pick out work, on account of mistakes.</p>
<p>\
It is wise to sew closely and tightly all new garments, which will never be altered in shape; but some are more nice than wise, in sewing frocks, and old garments, in the same style. However, this is the least common extreme. It is much more frequently the case, that articles, which ought to be strongly and neatly made, are sewed so that a nice sewer would rather pick out the threads and sew over again, than to be annoyed with the sight of grinning stitches, and vexed with constant rips.</p>
<p>\
<em>Workbaskets.</em>&nbsp;It is very important to neatness, comfort, and success in sewing, that a lady's workbasket should be properly fitted up. The following articles are needful to the mistress of a family: a large basket, to hold work; having in it, fastened, a smaller basket, or box, containing a needle-book, in which are needles of every size, both blunts and sharps, with a larger number of those sizes most used; also, small and large darning-needles, for woollen, cotton, and silk; two tape-needles, large and small; nice scissors, for fine work; buttonhole scissors; an emery-bag; two balls of white and yellow wax; and two thimbles, in case one should be mislaid. When a person is troubled with damp fingers, a lump of soft chalk, in a paper, is useful, to rub on the ends of the fingers.</p>
<p>\
Besides this box, keep in the basket, common scissors;&nbsp;small shears; a bag containing tapes, of all colors and sizes, done up in rolls; bags, one, containing spools of white, and another of colored, cotton thread, and another for silks, wound on spools or papers; a box or bag for nice buttons, and another for more common ones; a bag containing silk braid, welting cords, and galloon binding. Small rolls of pieces of white and brown linen and cotton, are also often needed. A brick pincushion is a great convenience, in sewing, and better than screw-cushions. It is made by covering half a brick with cloth, putting a cushion on the top, and covering it tastefully. It is very useful to hold pins and needles, while sewing, and to fasten long seams when basting and sewing.</p>
<p>\
<em>To make a Frock.</em>&nbsp;The best way for a novice, is, to get a dress fitted (not sewed) at the best mantuamaker's. Then take out a sleeve, rip it to pieces, and cut out a pattern. Then take out half of the waist, (it must have a seam in front,) and cut out a pattern of the back and fore-body, both lining and outer part. In cutting the patterns, iron the pieces, smooth, let the paper be stiff, and, with a pin, prick holes in the paper, to show the gore in front, and the depth of the seams. With a pen and ink, draw lines from each pinhole, to preserve this mark. Then baste the parts together again, in doing which, the unbasted half will serve as a pattern. When this is done, a lady of common ingenuity can cut and fit a dress, by these patterns. If the waist of a dress be too tight, the seam under the arm must be let out; and in cutting a dress, an allowance should be made, for letting it out, if needful, at this seam. The lining of the fore-body must be biased.</p>
<p>\
The linings for the waists of dresses should be stiffened cotton or linen. In cutting bias-pieces, for trimming, they will not set well, unless they are exact. In cutting them, use a long rule, and a lead pencil or piece of chalk. Welting-cords should be covered with bias-pieces; and it saves time, in many cases, to baste&nbsp;on the welting-cord, at the same time that you cover it. The best way to put on hooks and eyes, is to sew them on double broad tape, and then sew this on the frock-lining. They can then be moved easily, and do not show where they are sewed on.</p>
<p>\
In cutting a sleeve, double it biased. The skirts of dresses look badly, if not full; and in putting on lining, at the bottom, be careful to have it a very little fuller than the dress, or it will shrink, and look badly. All thin silks look much better with lining, and last much longer, as do aprons, also. In putting a lining to a dress, baste it on each separate breadth, and sew it in at the seams, and it looks much better than to have it fastened only at the bottom. Make notches in selvedge, to prevent it from drawing up the breadth. Dresses, which are to be washed, should not be lined.</p>
<p>\
Figured silks do not generally wear well, if the figure be large and satin-like. Black and plain-colored silks can be tested, by procuring samples, and making creases in them; fold the creases in a bunch, and rub them against a rough surface, of moreen or carpeting. Those which are poor, will soon wear off, at the creases. Plaids look becoming, for tall women, as they shorten the appearance of the figure. Stripes look becoming, on a large person, as they reduce the apparent size. Pale persons should not wear blue or green, and brunettes should not wear light delicate colors, except shades of buff, fawn, or straw color. Pearl white is not good for any complexion. Dead white and black look becoming on almost all persons. It is best to try colors, by candle-light, for evening dresses; as some colors, which look very handsome in the daylight, are very homely when seen by candle-light. Never cut a dress low in the neck, as this shows that a woman is not properly instructed in the rules of modesty and decorum, or that she has not sense enough to regard them. Never be in haste to be first in a fashion, and never go to the extremes.</p>
<p>\
In buying linen, seek for that which has a round close thread, and is perfectly white; for, if it be not white, at first, it will never afterwards become so. Much that is called linen, at the shops, is half cotton, and does not wear so well as cotton alone. Cheap linens are usually of this kind. It is difficult to discover which are all linen; but the best way, is, to find a lot, presumed to be good, take a sample, wash it, and ravel it. If this be good, the rest of the same lot will probably be so. If you cannot do this, draw a thread, each way, and if both appear equally strong, it is probably all linen. Linen and cotton must be put in clean water, and boiled, to get out the starch, and then ironed. A long piece of linen, a yard wide, will, with care and calculation, make eight shirts. In cutting it, take a shirt of the right size, as a guide, in fitting and basting. Bosom-pieces, false collars, &amp;c. must be cut and fitted, by a pattern which suits the person for whom the articles are designed. Gentlemen's night-shirts are made like other shirts, except that they are longer. In cutting chemises, if the cotton or linen is a yard wide, cut off small half gores, at the top of the breadths, and set them on the bottom. Use a long rule and a pencil, in cutting gores. In cutting cotton, which is quite wide, a seam can be saved, by cutting out two at once, in this manner:â€”cut off three breadths, and, with a long rule and a pencil, mark and cut off the gores, thus: from one breadth, cut off two gores, the whole length, each gore one fourth of the breadth, at the bottom, and tapering off to a point, at the top. The other two breadths are to have a gore cut off from each, which is one fourth wide at top, and two fourths at bottom. Arrange these pieces right, and they will make two chemises, one having four seams, and the other three. This is a much easier way of cutting, than sewing the three breadths together, in bag-fashion, as is often done. The biased, or goring seams, must always be felled. The sleeves and neck can be cut according to the taste of the wearer, by another chemise&nbsp;for a pattern. There should be a lining around the armholes, and stays at all corners. Six yards, of yard width, will make two chemises.</p>
<p>\
Old silk dresses, quilted for skirts, are very serviceable. White flannel is soiled so easily, and shrinks so much in washing, that it is a good plan to color it a light dove-color, according to the receipt given on page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/21829/pg21829-images.html#Page_301">301</a>. Cotton flannel, dyed thus, is also good for common skirts. In making up flannel, back-stitch and run the seams, and then cross-stitch them open. Nice flannel, for infants, can be ornamented, with very little expense of time, by turning up the hem, on the right side, and making a little vine at the edge, with saddler's silk. The stitch of the vine is a modification of buttonhole-stitch.</p>
<p>\
Long night gowns are best, cut a little goring. It requires five yards, for a long nightgown, and two and a half for a short one. Linen nightcaps wear longer than cotton ones, and do not, like them, turn yellow. They should be ruffled with linen, as cotton borders will not last so long as the cap. A double-quilted wrapper is a great comfort, in case of sickness. It may be made of two old dresses. It should not be cut full, but rather like a gentleman's study-gown, having no gathers or plaits, but large enough to slip off and on with ease. A double gown, of calico, is also very useful. Most articles of dress, for grown persons or children, require patterns.</p>
<p>\
<em>Bedding.</em>&nbsp;The best beds, are thick hair mattresses, which, for persons in health, are good for Winter as well as Summer use. Mattresses may also be made of husks, dried and drawn into shreds; also, of alternate layers of cotton and moss. The most profitable sheeting, is the Russian, which will last three times as long as any other. It is never perfectly white. Unbleached cotton is good for Winter. It is poor economy to make narrow and short sheets, as children and domestics will always slip them off, and soil the bedtick and bolster. They should be three yards long, and two&nbsp;and a half wide, so that they can be tucked in all around. All bed-linen should be marked and numbered, so that a bed can always be made properly, and all missing articles be known.</p>
<p>\
<em>Mending.</em>&nbsp;Silk dresses will last much longer, by ripping out the sleeves, when thin, and changing the arms, and also the breadths of the skirt. Tumbled black silk, which is old and rusty, should be dipped in water, then be drained for a few minutes, without squeezing or pressing, and then ironed. Cold tea is better than water. Sheets, when worn thin in the middle, should be ripped, and the other edges sewed together. Window-curtains last much longer, if lined, as the sun fades and rots them. Broadcloth should be cut with reference to the way the nap runs. When pantaloons are thin, it is best to newly seat them, cutting the piece inserted in a curve, as corners are difficult to fit. When the knees are thin, it is a case of domestic surgery, which demands&nbsp;<em>amputation</em>. This is performed, by cutting off both legs, some distance above the knees, and then changing the legs. Take care to cut them off exactly of the same length, or in the exchange they will not fit. This method brings the worn spot under the knees, and the seam looks much better than a patch and darn. Hose can be cut down, when the feet are worn. Take an old stocking, and cut it up for a pattern. Make the heel short. In sewing, turn each edge, and run it down, and then sew over the edges. This is better than to stitch and then cross-stitch. Run thin places in stockings, and it will save darning a hole. If shoes are worn through on the sides, in the upper-leather, slip pieces of broadcloth under, and sew them around the holes. If, in sewing, the thread kinks, break it off and begin at the other end. In using spool-cotton, thread the needle with the end which comes off first, and not the end where you break it off. This often prevents kinks.</p>

<h2 id="chapterxxviiicharacterofthecreator">CHAPTER XXVIII. CHARACTER OF THE CREATOR.</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;preceding pages have exhibited the nature of mind, the object of its formation, the right mode of action to secure this object, and the causes and results of its right and wrong action, as indicated by reason and experience.</p>
<p>\
We are now furnished with farther data to guide us in regard to the character of our Creator, as we seek it by the light of reason alone.</p>
<p>\
We have seen, in the chapter on intuitive truths, that by the first of these principles we arrive at the knowledge of some&nbsp;<em>eternal First Cause of all finite things</em>.</p>
<p>\
By another of these principles we deduce certain particulars in regard to his character as exhibited through his works. This principle is thus expressed: "Design is evidence of an intelligent cause, and the nature of a design proves the character and intention of the author." We are now prepared to show how much must be included in this truth.</p>
<p>\
Our only idea of "an intelligent cause" is that of&nbsp;<em>a mind like our own</em>. This being so, we assume that we are instructed, by the very constitution of our own minds, that our Creator is a being endowed with intellect, susceptibilities, and will, and a part of these susceptibilities are those included in our&nbsp;<em>moral constitution</em>.</p>
<p>\
This moral nature, which we are thus led to ascribe to our Creator, includes, in the first place, the existence of a feeling that whatever lessens or destroys happiness is unfitted to the system of the universe, and that&nbsp;<em>voluntary sacrifice and suffering to purchase the highest possible happiness is fitted to or in accordance with the eternal nature of things</em>.</p>
<p>\
Next, we are thus taught that in the Eternal Mind is existing that&nbsp;<em>sense of justice</em>&nbsp;which involves the desire of good to the author of good, and of evil to the author of evil, which requires that such retributions be&nbsp;<em>proportioned</em>&nbsp;to the good and evil done, and to the&nbsp;<em>voluntary</em>&nbsp;power of the agent.</p>
<p>\
Lastly, we are thus instructed that the Author of all created things possesses that susceptibility called&nbsp;<em>conscience</em>, which includes, in the very constitution of mind itself, retributions for right and wrong actions.</p>
<p>\
But while we thus assume that the mind of the Creator is, so far as we can conceive, precisely like our own in constitutional organization, we are as necessarily led to perceive that the&nbsp;<em>extent</em>&nbsp;of these powers is far beyond our own. A mind with the power, wisdom, and goodness exhibited in the very small portion of his works submitted to our inspection, who has inhabited eternity, and developed and matured through everlasting agesâ€”our minds are lost in attempting any conception of the extent of such infinite faculties!</p>
<p>\
But we have another intuitive truth to aid in our deductions. It is that by which we infer the continuance of a&nbsp;<em>uniformity in our experience</em>; that is, we necessarily believe that "things will continue as they are and have been, unless there is evidence to the contrary."&nbsp;Now all past experience as to the nature of mind has been uniform. Every mind known to us is endowed with intellect, susceptibility, and will, like our own. So much is this the case, that when any of these are wanting in a human being, we say he has "lost his mind."</p>
<p>\
Again: all our experience of mind involves the idea of the&nbsp;<em>mutual relation of minds</em>. We perceive that minds are made to match to other minds, so that there can be no complete action of mind, according to its manifest design, except in relation to other beings. A mind can not love till there is another mind to call forth such emotion. A mind can not bring a tithe of its power into appropriate action except in a community of minds. The conception of a solitary being, with all the social powers and sympathies of the human mind infinitely enlarged, and yet without any sympathizing mind to match and meet them, involves the highest idea of unfitness and imperfection conceivable.</p>
<p>\
Thus it is that past experience of the nature of mind leads to the inference that no mind has existed from all eternity&nbsp;<em>in solitude</em>, but that there is&nbsp;<em>more than one eternal, uncreated mind</em>, and that all their powers of enjoyment from giving and receiving happiness in social relations have been in exercise from eternal ages. This is the just and natural deduction of reason and experience, as truly as the deduction that there is at least one eternal First Cause.</p>
<p>\
It has been argued that the&nbsp;<em>unity of design</em>&nbsp;in the works of nature proves that there is but one creating mind. This is not so, for in all our experience of the&nbsp;creations of finite beings no&nbsp;<em>great design</em>&nbsp;was ever formed without a combination of minds, both to plan and to execute. The majority of minds in all ages, both heathen and Christian, have always conceived of the Creator as&nbsp;<em>in some way</em>&nbsp;existing so as to involve the ideas of plurality and of the love and communion of one mind with another.</p>
<p>\
Without a revelation, also, we have the means of arriving at the conclusion that the Creator of all things is not only a mind organized just like our own, but that he always has and always will feel and act right. We infer this from both his social and his moral constitution; for he must, as our own minds do, desire the love, reverence, and confidence of his creatures. The fact that he has made them to love truth, justice, benevolence, and self-sacrificing virtue is evidence that he has and will exhibit these and all other excellences that call forth affection.</p>
<p>\
But we have still stronger evidence. We have seen all the causes that experience has taught as the leading to the wrong action of mind. These are necessarily excluded from our conceptions of the Creator. The Eternal Mind can not err for want of knowledge, nor for want of habits of right action, nor for want of teachers and educators, nor for want of those social influences which generate and sustain a right governing purpose; for an infinite mind, that never had a beginning, can not have these modes of experience which appertain to new-born and finite creatures.</p>
<p>\
Again: we have seen that it is one of the implanted principles of reason that "no rational mind will choose evil without hope of compensating good." Such is&nbsp;the eternal system of the universe, as we learn it by the light of reason, that the highest possible happiness to each individual mind and to the whole commonwealth is promoted by the right action of every mind in that system. This, of necessity, is seen and felt by the All-creating and Eternal Mind, and to suppose that, with this knowledge, he would ever choose wrong is to suppose that he would choose pure evil, and this is contrary to an intuitive truth. It is to suppose the Creator would do what he has formed our minds to believe to be impossible in&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;rational mind. It is to suppose that the Creator would do that which, if done by human beings, marks them as insane.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[â€œOn earth is known to noneThe smile that is not sister to a tear.â€Elliott.

MargaretÂ and her father walked home. The night was fine, the streets clean, and with her pretty white silk, like Leezie Lindsayâ€™s gown oâ€™ green satin, in the ballad, â€œkilted up to her knee,â€ she was off with her fatherâ€”ready to dance along with the excitement of the cool, fresh night air.

â€œI rather think Thornton is not quite easy in his mind about this strike. He seemed very anxious to-night.â€

â€œI should wonder if he were not. But he spoke with his usual coolness to the others, when they suggested different things, just before we came away.â€

â€œSo he did after dinner as well. It would take a good deal to stir him from his cool manner of speaking; but his face strikes me as anxious.â€

â€œI should be, if I were he. He must know of the growing anger and hardly smothered hatred of his workpeople, who all looked upon him as what the Bible calls a â€˜hard man,â€™â€”not so much unjust as unfeeling; clear in judgment, standing upon his â€˜rightsâ€™ as no human being ought to stand, considering what we and all our petty rights are in the sight of the Almighty. I am glad you think he looks anxious. When I remember Boucherâ€™s half mad words and ways, I cannot bear to think how coolly Mr. Thornton spoke.â€

â€œIn the first place, I am not so convinced as you are about that man Boucherâ€™s utter distress; for the moment, he was badly off, I donâ€™t doubt. But there is always a mysterious supply of money from these Unions; and, from what you said, it was evident the man was of a passionate, demonstrative nature, and gave strong expression to all he felt.â€

â€œOh, papa!â€

â€œWell! I only want you to do justice to Mr. Thornton, who is, I suspect, of an exactly opposite natureâ€”a man who is far too proud to show his feelings. Just the character I should have thought beforehand, you would have admired, Margaret.â€

â€œSo I doâ€”so I should; but I donâ€™t feel quite so sure as you do of the existence of those feelings. He is a man of great strength of characterâ€”of unusual intellect, considering the few advantages he has had.â€]]></description>

To be sure, he needs some of the knowledge of the past, which gives the truest basis for conjecture as to the future; but he knows this needâ€”he perceives it, and that is something. You are quite prejudiced against Mr. Thornton, Margaret.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œHe is the first specimen of a manufacturerâ€”of a person engaged in tradeâ€”that I had ever the opportunity of studying, papa. He is my first olive: let me make a face while I swallow it. I know he is good of his kind, and by and by I shall like the kind. I rather think I am already beginning to do so. I was very much interested by what the gentlemen were talking about, although I did not understand half of it. I was quite sorry when Miss Thornton came to take me to the other end of the room, saying she was sure I should be uncomfortable at being the only lady among so many gentlemen. I had never thought about it, I was so busy listening; and the ladies were so dull, papaâ€”oh, so dull! Yet I think it was clever too. It reminded me of our old game of having each so many nouns to introduce into a sentence.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œWhat do you mean, child?â€ asked Mr. Hale.</p>
<p>\
â€œWhy, they took nouns that were signs of things which gave evidence of wealth,â€”housekeepers, under-gardeners, extent of glass, valuable lace, diamonds, and all such things; and each one formed her speech so as to bring them all in, in the prettiest accidental manner possible.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œYou will be as proud of your one servant when you get her, if all is true about her that Mrs. Thornton says.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œTo be sure, I shall. I felt like a great hypocrite to-night, sitting there in my white silk gown, with my idle hands before me, when I remembered all the good, thorough, house-work they had done to-day. They took me for a fine lady, Iâ€™m sure.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œEven I was mistaken enough to think you looked like a lady, my dear,â€ said Mr. Hale, quietly smiling.</p>
<p>\
But smiles were changed to white and trembling looks when they saw Dixonâ€™s face, as she opened the door.</p>
<p>\
â€œOh, master!â€”Oh, Miss Margaret! Thank God you are come! Dr. Donaldson is here. The servant next door went for him, for the charwoman is gone home. Sheâ€™s better now; but, oh sir! I thought sheâ€™d have died an hour ago.â€</p>
<p>\
Mr. Hale caught Margaretâ€™s arm to steady himself from falling. He looked at her face, and saw an expression upon it of surprise and extremest sorrow, but not the agony of terror that contracted his own unprepared heart. She knew more than he did, and yet she listened with that hopeless expression of awed apprehension.</p>
<p>\
â€œOh! I should not have left herâ€”wicked daughter that I am!â€ moaned forth Margaret, as she supported her trembling fatherâ€™s hasty steps upstairs. Dr. Donaldson met them on the landing.</p>
<p>\
â€œShe is better now,â€ he whispered. â€œThe opiate has taken effect. The spasms were very bad: no wonder they frightened your maid; but sheâ€™ll rally this time.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œThis time! Let me go to her!â€ Half an hour ago Mr. Hale was a middle-aged man; now his sight was dim, his senses wavering, his walk tottering, as if he were seventy years of age.</p>
<p>\
Dr. Donaldson took his arm, and led him into the bedroom. Margaret followed close. There lay her mother, with an unmistakeable look on her face. She might be better now; she was sleeping, but Death had signed her for his own, and it was clear that ere long he would return to take possession. Mr. Hale looked at her for some time without a word. Then he began to shake all over, and, turning away from Dr. Donaldsonâ€™s anxious care, he groped to find the door; he could not see it, although several candles, brought in the sudden affright, were burning and flaring there. He staggered into the drawing-room, and felt about for a chair. Dr. Donaldson wheeled one to him, and placed him in it. He felt his pulse.</p>
<p>\
â€œSpeak to him, Miss Hale. We must rouse him.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œPapa!â€ said Margaret, with a crying voice that was wild with pain. â€œPapa! Speak to me!â€ The speculation came again into his eyes, and he made a great effort.</p>
<p>\
â€œMargaret, did you know of this? Oh, it was cruel of you!â€</p>
<p>\
â€œNo, sir, it was not cruel!â€ replied Dr. Donaldson, with quick decision. â€œMiss Hale acted under my directions. There may have been a mistake, but it was not cruel. Your wife will be a different creature to-morrow, I trust. She has had spasms, as I anticipated, though I did not tell Miss Hale of my apprehensions. She has taken the opiate I brought with me; she will have a good long sleep; and to-morrow that look which has alarmed you so much will have passed away.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œBut not the disease?â€</p>
<p>\
Dr. Donaldson glanced at Margaret. Her bent head, her face raised with no appeal for a temporary reprieve, showed that quick observer of human nature that she thought it better that the whole truth should be told.</p>
<p>\
â€œNot the disease. We cannot touch the disease, with all our poor vaunted skill. We can only delay its progressâ€”alleviate the pain it causes. Be a man, sirâ€”a Christian. Have faith in the immortality of the soul, which no pain, no mortal disease, can assail or touch!â€</p>
<p>\
But all the reply he got was in the choked words, â€œYou have never been married, Dr. Donaldson; you donâ€™t know what it is,â€ and in the deep, manly sobs, which went through the stillness of the night like heavy pulses of agony.</p>
<p>\
Margaret knelt by him, caressing him with tearful caresses. No one, not even Dr. Donaldson, knew how the time went by. Mr. Hale was the first to dare to speak of the necessities of the present moment.</p>
<p>\
â€œWhat must we do?â€ asked he. â€œTell us both. Margaret is my staffâ€”my right hand.â€</p>
<p>\
Dr. Donaldson gave his clear, sensible directions. No fear for to-nightâ€”nay, even peace for to-morrow, and for many days yet. But no enduring hope of recovery. He advised Mr. Hale to go to bed, and leave only one to watch the slumber, which he hoped would be undisturbed. He promised to come again early in the morning. And, with a warm and kindly shake of the hand, he left them.</p>
<p>\
They spoke but few words; they were too much exhausted by their terror to do more than decide upon the immediate course of action. Mr. Hale was resolved to sit up through the night, and all that Margaret could do was to prevail upon him to rest on the drawing-room sofa. Dixon stoutly and bluntly refused to go to bed; and, as for Margaret, it was simply impossible that she should leave her mother, let all the doctors in the world speak of â€œhusbanding resources,â€ and â€œone watcher only being required.â€ So, Dixon sat, and stared, and winked, and drooped, and picked herself up again with a jerk, and finally gave up the battle, and fairly snored. Margaret had taken off her gown and tossed it aside with a sort of impatient disgust, and put on her dressing-gown. She felt as if she never could sleep again; as if her whole senses were acutely vital, and all endued with double keenness, for the purpose of watching. Every sight and soundâ€”nay, even every thought, touched some nerve to the very quick. For more than two hours, she heard her fatherâ€™s restless movements in the next room. He came perpetually to the door of her motherâ€™s chamber, pausing there to listen, till she, not hearing his close unseen presence, went and opened it to tell him how all went on, in reply to the questions his baked lips could hardly form. At last he, too, fell asleep, and all the house was still. Margaret sat behind the curtain thinking. Far away in time, far away in space, seemed all the interests of past days. Not more than thirty-six hours ago, she cared for Bessy Higgins and her father, and her heart was wrung for Boucher; now, that was all like a dreaming memory of some former life;â€”everything that had passed out of doors seemed dissevered from her mother, and therefore unreal. Even Harley Street appeared more distinct; there she remembered, as if it were yesterday, how she had pleased herself with tracing out her motherâ€™s features in her Aunt Shawâ€™s face,â€”and how letters had come, making her dwell on the thoughs of home with all the longing of love. Helstone, itself, was in the dim past. The dull gray days of the preceding winter and spring, so uneventless and monotonous, seemed more associated with what she cared for now above all price. She would fain have caught at the skirts of that departing time, and prayed it to return, and give her back what she had too little valued while it was yet in her possession. What a vain show Life seemed! How unsubstantial, and flickering, and flitting! It was as if from some aÃ«rial belfry, high up above the stir and jar of the earth, there was a bell continually tolling, â€œAll are shadows!â€”all are passing!â€”all is past!â€ And when the morning dawned, cool and gray, like many a happier morning beforeâ€”when Margaret looked one by one at the sleepers, it seemed as if the terrible night were unreal as a dream; it, too, was a shadow. It, too, was past.</p>
<p>\
Mrs. Hale herself was not aware when she awoke, how ill she had been the night before. She was rather surprised at Dr. Donaldsonâ€™s early visit, and perplexed by the anxious faces of husband and child. She consented to remain in bed that day, saying she certainly was tired; but, the next, she insisted on getting up; and Dr. Donaldson gave his consent to her returning into the drawing-room. She was restless and uncomfortable in every position, and before night she became very feverish. Mr. Hale was utterly listless, and incapable of deciding on anything.</p>
<p>\
â€œWhat can we do to spare mamma such another night?â€ asked Margaret on the third day.</p>
<p>\
â€œIt is to a certain degree, the reaction after the powerful opiates I have been obliged to use. It is more painful for you to see than for her to bear, I believe. But, I think, if we could get a water-bed it might be a good thing. Not but what she will be better to-morrow; pretty much like herself as she was before this attack. Still, I should like her to have a water-bed. Mrs. Thornton has one, I know. Iâ€™ll try and call there this afternoon. Stay,â€ said he, his eye catching on Margaretâ€™s face, blanched with watching in a sick room, â€œIâ€™m not sure whether I can go; Iâ€™ve a long round to take. It would do you no harm to have a brisk walk to Marlborough Street, and ask Mrs. Thornton if she can spare it.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œCertainly,â€ said Margaret. â€œI could go while mamma is asleep this afternoon. Iâ€™m sure Mrs. Thornton would lend it to us.â€</p>
<p>\
Dr. Donaldsonâ€™s experience told him rightly. Mrs. Hale seemed to shake off the consequences of her attack, and looked brighter and better this afternoon than Margaret had ever hoped to see her again. Her daughter left her after dinner, sitting in her easy chair, with her hand lying in her husbandâ€™s, who looked more worn and suffering than she by far. Still, he could smile nowâ€”rather slowly, rather faintly, it is true; but a day or two before, Margaret never thought to see him smile again.</p>
<p>\
It was about two miles from their house in Crampton Crescent to Marlborough Street. It was too hot to walk very quickly. An August sun beat straight down into the street at three oâ€™clock in the afternoon. Margaret went along, without noticing anything very different from usual in the first mile and a half of her journey; she was absorbed in her own thoughts, and had learnt by this time to thread her way through the irregular stream of human beings that flowed through Milton streets. But, by and by, she was struck with an unusual heaving among the mass of people in the crowded road on which she was entering. They did not appear to be moving on, so much as talking, and listening, and buzzing with excitement without much stirring from the spot where they might happen to be. Still, as they made way for her, and, wrapt up in the purpose of her errand, and the necessities that suggested it, she was less quick of observation than she might have been, if her mind had been at ease. She had got into Marlborough Street before the full conviction forced itself upon her, that there was a restless, oppressive sense of irritation abroad among the people; a thunderous atmosphere, morally as well as physically, around her. From every narrow lane opening out on Marlborough Street came up a low distant roar, as of myriads of fierce indignant voices. The inhabitants of each poor squalid dwelling were gathered round the doors and windows, if indeed they were not actually standing in the middle of the narrow waysâ€”all with looks intent towards one point. Marlborough Street itself was the focus of all those human eyes, that betrayed intensest interest of various kinds; some fierce with anger, some lowering with relentless threats! some dilated with fear, or imploring entreaty; and as Margaret reached the small side-entrance by the folding doors, in the great dead wall of Marlborough mill-yard, and waited the porterâ€™s answer to the bell, she looked round and heard the first long far-off roll of the tempest;â€”saw the first slow-surging wave of the dark crowd come, with its threatening crest, tumble over, and retreat, at the far end of the street, which a moment ago seemed so full of repressed noise, but which now was ominously still; all these circumstances forced themselves on Margaretâ€™s notice, but did not sink down into her pre-occupied heart. She did not know what they meantâ€”what was their deep significance; while she did know, did feel the keen sharp pressure of the knife that was soon to stab her through and through by leaving her motherless. She was trying to realise that, in order that, when it came, she might be ready to comfort her father.</p>
<p>\
The porter opened the door cautiously, not nearly wide enough to admit her.</p>
<p>\
â€œItâ€™s you, is it, maâ€™am?â€ said he, drawing a long breath, and widening the entrance, but still not opening it fully. Margaret went in. He hastily bolted it behind her.</p>
<p>\
â€œThâ€™ folk are all coming up here, I reckon?â€ asked he.</p>
<p>\
â€œI donâ€™t know. Something unusual seemed going on; but this street is quite empty, I think.â€</p>
<p>\
She went across the yard and put up the steps to the house door. There was no near sound,â€”no steam engine at work with beat and pant,â€”no click of machinery, no mingling and clashing of many sharp voices; but far away, the ominous gathering roar, deep-clamouring.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[WhyÂ do I write my melancholy story? Is it as a lesson, to prevent any other from wishing to rise to rank superior to that in which they are born? No! miserable as I am, others might have been happy, I doubt not, in my position: the chalice has been poisoned for me alone! Am I evil-mindedâ€”am I wicked? What have been my errors, that I am now an outcast and wretched? I will tell my storyâ€”let others judge me; my mind is bewildered, I cannot judge myself.

My father was land steward to a wealthy nobleman. He married young, and had several children. He then lost his wife, and remained fifteen years a widower, when he married again a young girl, the daughter of a clergyman, who died, leaving a numerous offspring in extreme poverty. My maternal grandfather had been a man of sensibility and genius; my mother inherited many of his endowments. She was an angel on earth; all her works were charity, all her thoughts were love.

Within a year after her marriage, she gave birth to twinsâ€”I and my sister; soon after she fell into ill-health, and from that time was always weakly. She could endure no fatigue, and seldom moved from her chair. I see her now;â€”her white, delicate hands employed in needlework, her soft, love-lighted eyes fixed on me. I was still a child when my father fell into trouble, and we removed from the part of the country where we had hitherto lived, and went to a distant village, where we rented a cottage, with a little land adjoining. We were poor, and all the family assisted each other. My elder half-sisters were strong, industrious, rustic young women, and submitted to a life of labour with great cheerfulness. My father held the plough, my half-brothers worked in the barns; all was toil, yet all seemed enjoyment.

How happy my childhood was! Hand in hand with my dear twin-sister, I plucked the spring flowers in the hedges, turned the hay in the summer meadows, shook the apples from the trees in the autumn, and at all seasons, gambolled in delicious liberty beneath the free air of heaven; or at my motherâ€™s feet, caressed by her, I was taught the sweetest lessons of charity and love. My elder sisters were kind; we were all linked by strong affection. The delicate, fragile existence of my mother gave an interest to our monotony, while her virtues and her refinement threw a grace over our homely household.

I and my sister did not seem twins, we were so unlike. She was robust, chubby, full of life and spirits; I, tall, slim, fair, and even pale. I loved to play with her, but soon grew tired, and then I crept to my motherâ€™s side, and she sang me to sleep, and nursed me in her bosom, and looked on me with her own angelic smile. She took pains to instruct me, not in accomplishments, but in all real knowledge. She unfolded to me the wonders of the visible creation, and to each tale of bird and beast, of fiery mountain or vast river, was appended some moral, derived from her warm heart and ardent imagination. Above all, she impressed upon me the precepts of the gospel, charity to every fellow-creature, the brotherhood of mankind, the rights that every sentient creature possesses to our services. I was her almoner; for, poor as she was, she was the benefactress of those who were poorer. Being delicate, I helped her in her task of needlework, while my sister aided the rest in their household or rustic labours.]]></description>

<p>Why&nbsp;do I write my melancholy story? Is it as a lesson, to prevent any other from wishing to rise to rank superior to that in which they are born? No! miserable as I am, others might have been happy, I doubt not, in my position: the chalice has been poisoned for me alone! Am I evil-mindedâ€”am I wicked? What have been my errors, that I am now an outcast and wretched? I will tell my storyâ€”let others judge me; my mind is bewildered, I cannot judge myself.</p>
<p>\
My father was land steward to a wealthy nobleman. He married young, and had several children. He then lost his wife, and remained fifteen years a widower, when he married again a young girl, the daughter of a clergyman, who died, leaving a numerous offspring in extreme poverty. My maternal grandfather had been a man of sensibility and genius; my mother inherited many of his endowments. She was an angel on earth; all her works were charity, all her thoughts were love.</p>
<p>\
Within a year after her marriage, she gave birth to twinsâ€”I and my sister; soon after she fell into ill-health, and from that time was always weakly. She could endure no fatigue, and seldom moved from her chair. I see her now;â€”her white, delicate hands employed in needlework, her soft, love-lighted eyes fixed on me. I was still a child when my father fell into trouble, and we removed from the part of the country where we had hitherto lived, and went to a distant village, where we rented a cottage, with a little land adjoining.

My father held the plough, my half-brothers worked in the barns; all was toil, yet all seemed enjoyment.</p>
<p>\
How happy my childhood was! Hand in hand with my dear twin-sister, I plucked the spring flowers in the hedges, turned the hay in the summer meadows, shook the apples from the trees in the autumn, and at all seasons, gambolled in delicious liberty beneath the free air of heaven; or at my motherâ€™s feet, caressed by her, I was taught the sweetest lessons of charity and love. My elder sisters were kind; we were all linked by strong affection. The delicate, fragile existence of my mother gave an interest to our monotony, while her virtues and her refinement threw a grace over our homely household.</p>
<p>\
I and my sister did not seem twins, we were so unlike. She was robust, chubby, full of life and spirits; I, tall, slim, fair, and even pale. I loved to play with her, but soon grew tired, and then I crept to my motherâ€™s side, and she sang me to sleep, and nursed me in her bosom, and looked on me with her own angelic smile. She took pains to instruct me, not in accomplishments, but in all real knowledge.

Above all, she impressed upon me the precepts of the gospel, charity to every fellow-creature, the brotherhood of mankind, the rights that every sentient creature possesses to our services. I was her almoner; for, poor as she was, she was the benefactress of those who were poorer. Being delicate, I helped her in her task of needlework, while my sister aided the rest in their household or rustic labours.</p>
<p>\
When I was seventeen, a miserable accident happened. A hayrick caught fire; it communicated to our outhouses, and at last to the cottage. We were roused from our beds at midnight, and escaped barely with our lives. My father bore out my mother in his arms, and then tried to save a portion of his property. The roof of the cottage fell in on him. He was dug out after an hour, scorched, maimed, crippled for life.</p>
<p>\
We were all saved, but by a miracle only was I preserved. I and my sister were awoke by cries of fire. The cottage was already enveloped in flames. Susan, with her accustomed intrepidity, rushed through the flames, and escaped; I thought only of my mother, and hurried to her room. The fire raged around me; it encircledâ€”hemmed me in. I believed that I must die, when suddenly I felt myself seized upon and borne away. I looked on my preserverâ€”it was Lord Reginald Desborough.</p>
<p>\
For many Sundays past, when, at church, I knew that Lord Reginaldâ€™s eyes were fixed on me. He had met me and Susan in our walks; he had called at our cottage. There was fascination in his eye, in his soft voice and earnest gaze, and my heart throbbed with gladness, as I thought that he surely loved me. To have been saved by him was to make the boon of life doubly precious.</p>
<p>\
There is to me much obscurity in this part of my story. Lord Reginald loved me, it is true; why he loved me, so far as to forget pride of rank and ambition for my sake, he who afterwards showed no tendency to disregard the prejudices and habits of rank and wealth, I cannot tell; it seems strange. He had loved me before, but from the hour that he saved my life, love grew into an overpowering passion. He offered us a lodge on his estate to take refuge in; and while there, he sent us presents of game, and still more kindly, fruits and flowers to my mother, and came himself, especially, when all were out except my mother and myself, and sat by us and conversed. Soon I learnt to expect the soft-asking look of his eyes, and almost dared answer it. My mother once perceived these glances, and took an opportunity to appeal to Lord Reginaldâ€™s good feelings, not to make me miserable for life, by implanting an attachment that could only be productive of unhappiness. His answer was to ask me in marriage.</p>
<p>\
I need not say that my mother gratefully consented; that my father, confined to his bed since the fire, thanked God with rapture; that my sisters were transported by delight: I was the least surprised then, though the most happy. Now, I wonder much, what could he see in me? So many girls of rank and fortune were prettier. I was an untaught, low-born, portionless girl. It was very strange.</p>
<p>\
Then I only thought of the happiness of marrying him, of being loved, of passing my life with him. My wedding day was fixed. Lord Reginald had neither father nor mother to interfere with his arrangements. He told no relation; he became one of our family during the interval. He saw no deficiencies in our mode of lifeâ€”in my dress; he was satisfied with all; he was tender, assiduous, and kind, even to my elder sisters; he seemed to adore my mother, and became a brother to my sister Susan. She was in love, and asked him to intercede to gain her parentsâ€™ consent for her choice. He did so; and though before, Lawrence Cooper, the carpenter of the place, had been disdained, supported by him, he was accepted. Lawrence Cooper was young, well-looking, well disposed, and fondly attached to Susan.</p>
<p>\
My wedding day came. My mother kissed me fondly, my father blessed me with pride and joy, my sisters stood round, radiant with delight. There was but one drawback to the universal happinessâ€”that immediately on my marriage I was to go abroad.</p>
<p>\
From the church door I stepped into the carriage. Having once and again been folded in my dear motherâ€™s embrace, the wheels were in motion, and we were away. I looked out from the window; there was the dear group: my old father, white-headed and aged, in his large chair; my mother, smiling through her tears, with folded hands and upraised looks of gratitude, anticipating long years of happiness for her child; Susan and Lawrence standing side by side, unenvious of my greatness, happy in themselves; my sisters conning over with pride and joy the presents made to them, and the prosperity that flowed in from my husbandâ€™s generosity. All looked happy, and it seemed as if I were the cause of all this happiness. We had been indeed saved from dreadful evils; ruin had ensued from the fire, and we had been sunk in adversity through that very event from which our good fortune took its rise. I felt proud and glad. I loved them all. I thought, I make them happyâ€”they are prosperous through me! And my heart warmed with gratitude towards my husband at the idea.</p>
<p>\
We spent two years abroad. It was rather lonely for me, who had always been surrounded, as it were, by a populous world of my own, to find myself cast upon foreigners and strangers; the habits of the different sexes in the higher ranks so separate them from each other, that, after a few months, I spent much of my time in solitude. I did not repine; I had been brought up to look upon the hard visage of life, if not unflinchingly, at least with resignation. I did not expect perfect happiness. Marriages in humble life are attended with so much care. I had none of this: my husband loved me; and though I often longed to see the dear familiar faces that thronged my childhoodâ€™s home, and, above all, pined for my motherâ€™s caresses and her wise maternal lessons, yet for a time I was content to think of them, and hope for a reunion.</p>
<p>\
Still many things pained me. I had, poor myself, been brought up among the poor, and nothing, since I can remember forming an idea, so much astonished and jarred with my feelings as the thought of how the rich could spend so much on themselves, while any of their fellow-creatures were in destitution. I had none of the patrician charity (though such is praiseworthy), which consists in distributing thin soup and coarse flannel petticoatsâ€”a sort of instinct or sentiment of justice, the offspring of my lowly paternal hearth, and my motherâ€™s enlightened piety, was deeply implanted in my mind, that all had as good a right to the comforts of life as myself, or even as my husband. My charities, they were calledâ€”they seemed to me the payment of my debts to my fellow-creaturesâ€”were abundant. Lord Reginald peremptorily checked them; but as I had a large allowance for my own expenses, I denied myself a thousand luxuries, for the sake of feeding the hungry. Nor was it only that charity impelled me, but that I could not acquire a taste for spending money on myselfâ€”I disliked the apparatus of wealth. My husband called my ideas sordid, and reproved me severely, when, instead of outshining all competitors at a fÃªte, I appeared dowdily dressed, and declared warmly that I could not, I would not, spend twenty guineas on a gown, while I could dress many sad faces in smiles, and bring much joy to many drooping hearts, by the same sum.</p>
<p>\
Was I right? I firmly believe that there is not one among the rich who will not affirm that I did wrong; that to please my husband, and do honour to his rank, was my first duty. Yet, shall I confess it? even now, rendered miserable by this faultâ€”I cannot give it that nameâ€”I can call it a misfortuneâ€”I have wasted at the slow fire of knowing that I lost my husbandâ€™s affections because I performed what I believed to be a duty.</p>
<p>\
But I am not come to that yet. It was not till my return to England that the full disaster crushed me. We had often been applied to for money by my family, and Lord Reginald had acceded to nearly all their requests. When we reached London, after two yearsâ€™ absence, my first wish was to see my dear mother. She was at Margate for her health. It was agreed that I should go there alone, and pay a short visit. Before I went, Lord Reginald told me what I did not know before, that my family had often made exorbitant demands on him, with which he was resolved not to comply. He told me that he had no wish to raise my relatives from their station in society; and that, indeed, there were only two among them whom he conceived had any claims upon meâ€”my mother and my twin-sister: that the former was incapable of any improper request and the latter, by marrying Cooper, had fixed her own position, and could in no way be raised from the rank of her chosen husband. I agreed to much that he said. I replied that he well knew that my own taste led me to consider mediocrity the best and happiest situation; that I had no wish, and would never consent, to supply any extravagant demands on the part of persons, however dear to me, whose circumstances he had rendered easy.</p>
<p>\
Satisfied with my reply, we parted most affectionately, and I went on my way to Margate with a light and glad heart; and the cordial reception I received from my whole family collected together to receive me, was calculated to add to my satisfaction. The only drawback to my content was my motherâ€™s state; she was wasted to a shadow. They all talked and laughed around her, but it was evident to me that she had not long to live.</p>
<p>\
There was no room for me in the small furnished house in which they were all crowded, so I remained at the hotel. Early in the morning, before I was up, my father visited me. He begged me to intercede with my husband; that on the strength of his support he had embarked in a speculation which required a large capital; that many families would be ruined, and himself dishonoured, if a few hundreds were not advanced. I promised to do what I could, resolving to ask my motherâ€™s advice, and make her my guide. My father kissed me with an effusion of gratitude, and left me.</p>
<p>\
I cannot enter into the whole of these sad details; all my half-brothers and sisters had married, and trusted to their success in life to Lord Reginaldâ€™s assistance. Each evidently thought that they asked little in not demanding an equal share of my luxuries and fortune; but they were all in difficultyâ€”all needed large assistanceâ€”all depended on me.</p>
<p>\
Lastly, my own sister Susan appealed to meâ€”but hers was the most moderate request of allâ€”she only wished for twenty pounds. I gave it her at once from my own purse.</p>
<p>\
As soon as I saw my mother I explained to her my difficulties. She told me that she expected this, and that it broke her heart: I must summon courage and resist these demands. That my fatherâ€™s imprudence had ruined him, and that he must encounter the evil he had brought on himself; that my numerous relatives were absolutely mad with the notion of what I ought to do for them. I listened with griefâ€”I saw the torments in store for meâ€”I felt my own weakness, and knew that I could not meet the rapacity of those about me with any courage or firmness. That same night my mother fell into convulsions; her life was saved with difficulty. From Susan I learned the cause of her attack. She had had a violent altercation with my father: she insisted that I should not be appealed to; while he reproached her for rendering me undutiful, and bringing ruin and disgrace on his grey hairs. When I saw my pale mother trembling, fainting, dyingâ€”when I was again and again assured that she must be my fatherâ€™s victim unless I yielded, what wonder that, in the agony of my distress, I wrote to my husband to implore his assistance.</p>
<p>\
Oh, what thick clouds now obscured my destiny! how do I remember, with a sort of thrilling horror, the boundless sea, white cliffs, and wide sands of Margate! The summer day that had welcomed my arrival changed to bleak wintry weather during this intervalâ€”while I waited with anguish for my husbandâ€™s answer. Well do I remember the evening on which it came: the waves of the sea showed their white crests, no vessel ventured to meet the gale with any canvas except a topsail, the sky was bared clear by the wind, the sun was going down fiery red. I looked upon the troubled watersâ€”I longed to be borne away upon them, away from care and misery. At this moment a servant followed me to the sands with my husbandâ€™s answerâ€”it contained a refusal. I dared not communicate it. The menaces of bankruptcy; the knowledge that he had instilled false hopes into so many; the fears of disgrace, rendered my father, always rough, absolutely ferocious. Life flickered in my dear motherâ€™s frame, it seemed on the point of expiring when she heard my fatherâ€™s step; if he came in with a smooth brow, her pale lips wreathed into her own sweet smile, and a delicate pink tinged her fallen cheeks; if he scowled, and his voice was high, every limb shivered, she turned her face to her pillow, while convulsive tears shook her frame, and threatened instant dissolution. My father sought me alone one day, as I was walking in melancholy guise upon the sands; he swore that he would not survive his disgrace. â€œAnd do you think, Fanny,â€ he added â€œthat your mother will survive the knowledge of my miserable end?â€ I saw the resolution of despair in his face as he spoke.â€”I asked the sum needed, the time when it must be given.â€”A thousand pounds in two days was all that was asked. I set off to London to implore my husband to give this sum.</p>
<p>\
No! no! I cannot step by step record my wretchednessâ€”the money was givenâ€”I extorted it from Lord Reginald, though I saw his very heart closed on me as he wrote the cheque. Worse had happened since I had left him. Susan had used the twenty pounds I gave her to reach town, to throw herself at my husbandâ€™s feet, and implore his compassion. Rendered absolutely insane by the idea of having a lord for a brother-in-law, Cooper had launched into a system of extravagance, incredible as it was wicked. He was many thousand pounds in debt, and when at last Lord Reginald wrote to refuse all further supply, the miserable man committed forgery. Two hundred pounds prevented exposure, and preserved him from an ignominious end. Five hundred more were advanced to send him and his wife to America, to settle there, out of the way of temptation. I parted from my dear sisterâ€”I loved her fondly; she had no part in her husbandâ€™s guilt, yet she was still attached to him, and her child bound them together; they went into solitary, miserable exile. â€œAh! had we remained in virtuous poverty,â€ cried my broken-hearted sister, â€œI had not been forced to leave my dying mother.â€</p>
<p>\
The thousand pounds given to my father was but a drop of water in the ocean. Again I was appealed to; again I felt the slender thread of my motherâ€™s life depended on my getting a supply. Again, trembling and miserable, I implored the charity of my husband.</p>
<p>\
â€œI am content,â€ he said, â€œto do what you ask, to do more than you ask; but remember the price you payâ€”either give up your parents and your family, whose rapacity and crimes deserve no mercy, or we part for ever. You shall have a proper allowance; you can maintain all your family on it if you please; but their names must never be mentioned to me again. Choose between usâ€”you never see them more, or we part for ever.â€</p>
<p>\
Did I do rightâ€”I cannot tellâ€”misery is the resultâ€”misery frightful, endless, unredeemed. My mother was dearer to me than all the world. I did not replyâ€”I rushed to my room, and that night, in a delirium of grief and horror, I set out for Margateâ€”such was my reply to my husband.</p>
<p>\
Three years have passed since then; and during all this time I was grateful to Heaven for being permitted to do my duty by my mother; and though I wept over the alienation of my husband, I did not repent. But she, my angelic support, is no more. My father survived my mother but two months; remorse for all he had done, and made me suffer, cut short his life. His family by his first wife are gathered round me; they importune, they rob, they destroy me. Last week I wrote to Lord Reginald. I communicated the death of my parents; I represented that my position was altered; and that if he still cared for his unhappy wife all might be well. Yesterday his answer came.â€”It was too late, he said;â€”I had myself torn asunder the ties that united usâ€”they never could be knit together again.</p>
<p>\
By the same post came a letter from Susan. She is happy. Cooper, awakened to a manly sense of the duties of life, is thoroughly reformed. He is industrious and prosperous. Susan asks me to join her. I am resolved to go. Oh! my home, and recollections of my youth, where are ye now? envenomed by serpentsâ€™ stings, I long to close my eyes on every scene I have ever viewed. Let me seek a strange land, a land where a grave will soon be opened for me. I desire to die. I am told that Lord Reginald loves another, a high-born girl; that he openly curses our union as the obstacle to his happiness. The memory of this will poison the oblivion I go to seek. He will soon be free. Soon will the hand he once so fondly took in his and made his own, which, now flung away, trembles with misery as it traces these lines, moulder in its last decay. \n </p>

            <description><![CDATA[Molly's father was not at home when she returned; and there was no one to give her a welcome. Mrs. Gibson was out paying calls, the servants told Molly. She went upstairs to her own room, meaning to unpack and arrange her borrowed books. Rather to her surprise she saw the chamber, corresponding to her own, being dusted; water and towels too were being carried in.

"Is any one coming?" she asked of the housemaid.

"Missus's daughter from France. Miss Kirkpatrick is coming to-morrow."

Was Cynthia coming at last? Oh, what a pleasure it would be to have a companion, a girl, a sister of her own age! Molly's depressed spirits sprang up again with bright elasticity. She longed for Mrs. Gibson's return, to ask her all about it: it must be very sudden, for Mr. Gibson had said nothing of it at the Hall the day before. No quiet reading now; the books were hardly put away with Molly's usual neatness. She went down into the drawing-room, and could not settle to anything. At last Mrs. Gibson came home, tired out with her walk and her heavy velvet cloak. Until that was taken off, and she had rested herself for a few minutes, she seemed quite unable to attend to Molly's questions.

"Oh, yes! Cynthia is coming home to-morrow, by the 'Umpire,' which passes through at ten o'clock. What an oppressive day it is for the time of the year! I really am almost ready to faint. Cynthia heard of some opportunity, I believe, and was only too glad to leave school a fortnight earlier than we planned. She never gave me the chance of writing to say I did, or did not, like her coming so much before the time; and I shall have to pay for her just the same as if she had stopped. And I meant to have asked her to bring me a French bonnet; and then you could have had one made after mine. But I'm very glad she's coming, poor dear."

"Is anything the matter with her?" asked Molly.

"Oh, no! Why should there be?"

"You called her 'poor dear,' and it made me afraid lest she might be ill."

"Oh, no! It's only a way I got into, when Mr. Kirkpatrick died. A fatherless girlâ€”you know one always does call them 'poor dears.' Oh, no! Cynthia never is ill. She's as strong as a horse. She never would have felt to-day as I have done. Could you get me a glass of wine and a biscuit, my dear? I'm really quite faint."

Mr. Gibson was much more excited about Cynthia's arrival than her own mother was. He anticipated her coming as a great pleasure to Molly, on whom, in spite of his recent marriage and his new wife, his interests principally centred. He even found time to run upstairs and see the bedrooms of the two girls; for the furniture of which he had paid a pretty round sum.

"Well, I suppose young ladies like their bedrooms decked out in this way! It's very pretty certainly,Â butâ€”"]]></description>

<p>Molly's father was not at home when she returned; and there was no one to give her a welcome. Mrs. Gibson was out paying calls, the servants told Molly. She went upstairs to her own room, meaning to unpack and arrange her borrowed books. Rather to her surprise she saw the chamber, corresponding to her own, being dusted; water and towels too were being carried in.</p>
<p>\
"Is any one coming?" she asked of the housemaid.</p>
<p>\
"Missus's daughter from France. Miss Kirkpatrick is coming to-morrow."</p>
<p>\
Was Cynthia coming at last? Oh, what a pleasure it would be to have a companion, a girl, a sister of her own age! Molly's depressed spirits sprang up again with bright elasticity. She longed for Mrs. Gibson's return, to ask her all about it: it must be very sudden, for Mr. Gibson had said nothing of it at the Hall the day before. No quiet reading now; the books were hardly put away with Molly's usual neatness. She went down into the drawing-room, and could not settle to anything. At last Mrs. Gibson came home, tired out with her walk and her heavy velvet cloak. Until that was taken off, and she had rested herself for a few minutes, she seemed quite unable to attend to Molly's questions.</p>
<p>\
"Oh, yes! Cynthia is coming home to-morrow, by the 'Umpire,' which passes through at ten o'clock. What an oppressive day it is for the time of the year! I really am almost ready to faint. Cynthia heard of some opportunity, I believe, and was only too glad to leave school a fortnight earlier than we planned. She never gave me the chance of writing to say I did, or did not, like her coming so much before the time; and I shall have to pay for her just the same as if she had stopped.

<p>\
"You called her 'poor dear,' and it made me afraid lest she might be ill."</p>

She never would have felt to-day as I have done. Could you get me a glass of wine and a biscuit, my dear? I'm really quite faint."</p>
<p>\
Mr. Gibson was much more excited about Cynthia's arrival than her own mother was. He anticipated her coming as a great pleasure to Molly, on whom, in spite of his recent marriage and his new wife, his interests principally centred. He even found time to run upstairs and see the bedrooms of the two girls; for the furniture of which he had paid a pretty round sum.</p>
<p>\
"Well, I suppose young ladies like their bedrooms decked out in this way! It's very pretty certainly,&nbsp;butâ€”"</p>
<p>\
"I liked my own old room better, papa; but perhaps Cynthia is accustomed to such decking up."</p>
<p>\
"Perhaps; at any rate, she'll see we've tried to make it pretty. Yours is like hers. That's right. It might have hurt her, if hers had been smarter than yours. Now, good-night in your fine flimsy bed."</p>
<p>\
Molly was up betimesâ€”almost before it was lightâ€”arranging her pretty Hamley flowers in Cynthia's room. She could hardly eat her breakfast that morning. She ran upstairs and put on her things, thinking that Mrs. Gibson was quite sure to go down to the "George Inn," where the "Umpire" stopped, to meet her daughter after a two years' absence. But, to her surprise, Mrs. Gibson had arranged herself at her great worsted-work frame, just as usual; and she, in her turn, was astonished at Molly's bonnet and cloak.</p>
<p>\
"Where are you going so early, child? The fog hasn't cleared away yet."</p>
<p>\
"I thought you would go and meet Cynthia; and I wanted to go with you."</p>
<p>\
"She will be here in half an hour; and dear papa has told the gardener to take the wheelbarrow down for her luggage. I'm not sure if he is not gone himself."</p>
<p>\
"Then are not you going?" asked Molly, with a good deal of disappointment.</p>
<p>\
"No, certainly not. She will be here almost directly. And, besides, I don't like to expose my feelings to every passer-by in High Street. You forget I have not seen her for two years, and I hate scenes in the market-place."</p>
<p>\
She settled herself to her work again; and Molly, after some consideration, gave up her own going, and employed herself in looking out of the downstairs window which commanded the approach from the town.</p>
<p>\
"Here she isâ€”here she is!" she cried out at last. Her father was walking by the side of a tall young lady; William the gardener was wheeling along a great cargo of baggage. Molly flew to the front-door, and had it wide open to admit the new-comer some time before she arrived.</p>
<p>\
"Well! here she is. Molly, this is Cynthia. Cynthia, Molly. You're to be sisters, you know."</p>
<p>\
Molly saw the beautiful, tall, swaying figure, against the light of the open door, but could not see any of the features that were, for the moment, in shadow. A sudden gush of shyness had come over her just at the instant, and quenched the embrace she would have given a moment before. But Cynthia took her in her arms, and kissed her on both cheeks.</p>
<p>\
"Here's mamma," she said, looking beyond Molly on to the stairs where Mrs. Gibson stood, wrapped up in a shawl, and shivering in the cold. She ran past Molly and Mr. Gibson, who rather averted their eyes from this first greeting between mother and child.</p>
<p>\
Mrs. Gibson saidâ€”</p>
<p>\
"Why, how you are grown, darling! You look quite a woman."</p>
<p>\
"And so I am," said Cynthia. "I was before I went away; I've hardly grown since,â€”except, it is always to be hoped, in wisdom."</p>
<p>\
"Yes! That we will hope," said Mrs. Gibson, in rather a meaning way. Indeed there were evidently hidden allusions in their seeming commonplace speeches. When they all came into the full light and repose of the drawing-room, Molly was absorbed in the contemplation of Cynthia's beauty. Perhaps her features were not regular; but the changes in her expressive countenance gave one no time to think of that. Her smile was perfect; her pouting charming; the play of the face was in the mouth. Her eyes were beautifully shaped, but their expression hardly seemed to vary. In colouring she was not unlike her mother; only she had not so much of the red-haired tints in her complexion; and her long-shaped, serious grey eyes were fringed with dark lashes, instead of her mother's insipid flaxen ones. Molly fell in love with her, so to speak, on the instant. She sate there warming her feet and hands, as much at her ease as if she had been there all her life; not particularly attending to her motherâ€”who, all the time, was studying either her or her dressâ€”measuring Molly and Mr. Gibson with grave observant looks, as if guessing how she should like them.</p>
<p>\
"There's hot breakfast ready for you in the dining-room, when you are ready for it," said Mr. Gibson. "I'm sure you must want it after your night journey." He looked round at his wife, at Cynthia's mother, but she did not seem inclined to leave the warm room again.</p>
<p>\
"Molly will take you to your room, darling," said she; "it is near hers, and she has got her things to take off. I'll come down and sit in the dining-room while you are having your breakfast, but I really am afraid of the cold now."</p>
<p>\
Cynthia rose and followed Molly upstairs.</p>
<p>\
"I'm so sorry there isn't a fire for you," said Molly, "butâ€”I suppose it wasn't ordered; and, of course, I don't give any orders. Here is some hot water, though."</p>
<p>\
"Stop a minute," said Cynthia, getting hold of both Molly's hands, and looking steadily into her face, but in such a manner that she did not dislike the inspection.</p>
<p>\
"I think I shall like you. I am so glad! I was afraid I should not. We're all in a very awkward position together, aren't we? I like your father's looks, though."</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6ZRU9KWUelUFPuqhWH3hNYIS4b02-wi93suq.jpeg" alt="First Impressions." /></p>
<p>\
Molly could not help smiling at the way this was said. Cynthia replied to her smile.</p>
<p>\
"Ah, you may laugh. But I don't know that I am easy to get on with; mamma and I didn't suit when we were last together. But perhaps we are each of us wiser now. Now, please leave me for a quarter of an hour. I don't want anything more."</p>
<p>\
Molly went into her own room, waiting to show Cynthia down to the dining-room. Not that, in the moderate-sized house, there was any difficulty in finding the way. A very little trouble in conjecturing would enable a stranger to discover any room. But Cynthia had so captivated Molly, that she wanted to devote herself to the new-comer's service. Ever since she had heard of the probability of her having a sisterâ€”(she called her a sister, but whether it was a Scotch sister, or a sister&nbsp;<em>Ã  la mode de BrÃ©tagne</em>, would have puzzled most people)â€”Molly had allowed her fancy to dwell much on the idea of Cynthia's coming; and in the short time since they had met, Cynthia's unconscious power of fascination had been exercised upon her. Some people have this power. Of course, its effects are only manifested in the susceptible. A school-girl may be found in every school who attracts and influences all the others, not by her virtues, nor her beauty, nor her sweetness, nor her cleverness, but by something that can neither be described nor reasoned upon. It is the something alluded to in the old&nbsp;lines:â€”</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>| Love me not for comely grace, \n For my pleasing eye and face; \n No, nor for my constant heart,â€” \n For these may change, and turn to ill, \n And thus true love may sever. \n But love me on, and know not why, \n So hast thou the same reason still \n To dote upon me ever. |
|----|</p>
<p>\
A woman will have this charm, not only over men but over her own sex; it cannot be defined, or rather it is so delicate a mixture of many gifts and qualities that it is impossible to decide on the proportions of each. Perhaps it is incompatible with very high principle; as its essence seems to consist in the most exquisite power of adaptation to varying people and still more various moods; "being all things to all men." At any rate, Molly might soon have been aware that Cynthia was not remarkable for unflinching morality; but the glamour thrown over her would have prevented Molly from any attempt at penetrating into and judging her companion's character, even had such processes been the least in accordance with her own disposition.</p>
<p>\
Cynthia was very beautiful, and was so well aware of this fact that she had forgotten to care about it; no one with such loveliness ever appeared so little conscious of it. Molly would watch her perpetually as she moved about the room, with the free stately step of some wild animal of the forestâ€”moving almost, as it were, to the continual sound of music. Her dress, too, though now to our ideas it would be considered ugly and disfiguring, was suited to her complexion and figure, and the fashion of it subdued within due bounds by her exquisite taste. It was inexpensive enough, and the changes in it were but few. Mrs. Gibson professed herself shocked to find that Cynthia had but four gowns, when she might have stocked herself so well, and brought over so many useful French patterns, if she had but patiently waited for her mother's answer to the letter which she had sent, announcing her return by the opportunity madame had found for her. Molly was hurt for Cynthia at all these speeches; she thought they implied that the pleasure which her mother felt in seeing her a fortnight sooner after her two years' absence was inferior to that which she would have received from a bundle of silver-paper patterns. But Cynthia took no apparent notice of the frequent recurrence of these small complaints. Indeed, she received much of what her mother said with a kind of complete indifference, that made Mrs. Gibson hold her rather in awe; and she was much more communicative to Molly than to her own child. With regard to dress, however, Cynthia soon showed that she was her mother's own daughter in the manner in which she could use her deft and nimble fingers. She was a capital workwoman; and, unlike Molly, who excelled in plain sewing, but had no notion of dressmaking or millinery, she could repeat the fashions she had only seen in passing along the streets of Boulogne, with one or two pretty rapid movements of her hands, as she turned and twisted the ribbons and gauze her mother furnished her with. So she refurbished Mrs. Gibson's wardrobe; doing it all in a sort of contemptuous manner, the source of which Molly could not quite make out.</p>
<p>\
Day after day the course of these small frivolities was broken in upon by the news Mr. Gibson brought of Mrs. Hamley's nearer approach to death. Mollyâ€”very often sitting by Cynthia, and surrounded by ribbon, and wire, and netâ€”heard the bulletins like the toll of a funeral bell at a marriage feast. Her father sympathized with her. It was the loss of a dear friend to him too; but he was so accustomed to death, that it seemed to him but as it was, the natural end of all things human. To Molly, the death of some one she had known so well and loved so much, was a sad and gloomy phenomenon. She loathed the small vanities with which she was surrounded, and would wander out into the frosty garden, and pace the walk, which was both sheltered and concealed by evergreens.</p>
<p>\
At lengthâ€”and yet it was not so long, not a fortnight since Molly had left the Hallâ€”the end came. Mrs. Hamley had sunk out of life as gradually as she had sunk out of consciousness and her place in this world. The quiet waves closed over her, and her place knew her no more.</p>
<p>\
"They all sent their love to you, Molly," said her father. "Roger said he knew how you would feel it."</p>
<p>\
Mr. Gibson had come in very late, and was having a solitary dinner in the dining-room. Molly was sitting near him to keep him company. Cynthia and her mother were upstairs. The latter was trying on a head-dress which Cynthia had made for her.</p>
<p>\
Molly remained downstairs after her father had gone out afresh on his final round among his town patients. The fire was growing very low, and the lights were waning. Cynthia came softly in, and taking Molly's listless hand, that hung down by her side, sat at her feet on the rug, chafing her chilly fingers without speaking. The tender action thawed the tears that had been gathering heavily at Molly's heart, and they came dropping down her cheeks.</p>
<p>\
"You loved her dearly, did you not, Molly?"</p>
<p>\
"Yes," sobbed Molly; and then there was a silence.</p>
<p>\
"Had you known her long?"</p>
<p>\
"No, not a year. But I had seen a great deal of her. I was almost like a daughter to her; she said so. Yet I never bid her good-by, or anything. Her mind became weak and confused."</p>
<p>\
"She had only sons, I think?"</p>
<p>\
"No; only Mr. Osborne and Mr. Roger Hamley. She had a daughter onceâ€”'Fanny.' Sometimes, in her illness, she used to call me 'Fanny.'"</p>
<p>\
The two girls were silent for some time, both gazing into the fire. Cynthia spoke&nbsp;first:â€”</p>
<p>\
"I wish I could love people as you do, Molly!"</p>
<p>\
"Don't you?" said the other, in surprise.</p>
<p>\
"No. A good number of people love me, I believe, or at least they think they do; but I never seem to care much for any one. I do believe I love you, little Molly, whom I have only known for ten days, better than any one."</p>
<p>\
"Not than your mother?" said Molly, in grave astonishment.</p>
<p>\
"Yes, than my mother!" replied Cynthia, half-smiling. "It's very shocking, I daresay; but it is so. Now, don't go and condemn me. I don't think love for one's mother quite comes by nature; and remember how much I have been separated from mine! I loved my father, if you will," she continued, with the force of truth in her tone, and then she stopped; "but he died when I was quite a little thing, and no one believes that I remember him. I heard mamma say to a caller, not a fortnight after his funeral, 'Oh, no, Cynthia is too young; she has quite forgotten him'â€”and I bit my lips, to keep from crying out, 'Papa! papa! have I?' But it's of no use. Well, then mamma had to go out as a governess; she couldn't help it, poor thing! but she didn't much care for parting with me. I was a trouble, I daresay. So I was sent to school at four years old; first one school, and then another; and in the holidays, mamma went to stay at grand houses, and I was generally left with the schoolmistresses. Once I went to the Towers; and mamma lectured me continually, and yet I was very naughty, I believe. And so I never went again; and I was very glad of it, for it was a horrid place."</p>
<p>\
"That it was!" said Molly, who remembered her own day of tribulation there.</p>
<p>\
"And once I went to London, to stay with my uncle Kirkpatrick. He is a lawyer, and getting on now; but then he was poor enough, and had six or seven children. It was winter-time, and we were all shut up in a small house in Doughty Street. But, after all, that wasn't so bad."</p>
<p>\
"But then you lived with your mother when she began school at Ashcombe. Mr. Preston told me that, when I stayed that day at the Manor-house."</p>
<p>\
"What did he tell you?" asked Cynthia, almost fiercely.</p>
<p>\
"Nothing but that. Oh, yes! He praised your beauty, and wanted me to tell you what he had said."</p>
<p>\
"I should have hated you if you had," said Cynthia.</p>
<p>\
"Of course I never thought of doing such a thing," replied Molly. "I didn't like him; and Lady Harriet spoke of him the next day, as if he wasn't a person to be liked."</p>
<p>\
Cynthia was quite silent. At length she said,â€”</p>
<p>\
"I wish I was good!"</p>
<p>\
"So do I," said Molly, simply. She was thinking again of Mrs.&nbsp;Hamley,â€”</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>| Only the actions of the just \n Smell sweet and blossom in the dust, |
|----|</p>
<p>\
and "goodness" just then seemed to her to be the only enduring thing in the world.</p>
<p>\
"Nonsense, Molly! You are good. At least, if you're not good, what am I? There's a rule-of-three sum for you to do! But it's no use talking; I am not good, and I never shall be now. Perhaps I might be a heroine still, but I shall never be a good woman, I know."</p>
<p>\
"Do you think it easier to be a heroine?"</p>
<p>\
"Yes, as far as one knows of heroines from history. I'm capable of a great jerk, an effort, and then a relaxationâ€”but steady, every-day goodness is beyond me. I must be a moral kangaroo!"</p>
<p>\
Molly could not follow Cynthia's ideas; she could not distract herself from the thoughts of the sorrowing group at the Hall.</p>
<p>\
"How I should like to see them all! and yet one can do nothing at such a time! Papa says the funeral is to be on Tuesday, and that, after that, Roger Hamley is to go back to Cambridge. It will seem as if nothing had happened! I wonder how the squire and Mr. Osborne Hamley will get on together."</p>
<p>\
"He's the eldest son, is he not? Why shouldn't he and his father get on well together?"</p>
<p>\
"Oh! I don't know. That is to say, I do know, but I think I ought not to tell."</p>
<p>\
"Don't be so pedantically truthful, Molly. Besides, your manner shows when you speak truth and when you speak falsehood, without troubling yourself to use words. I knew exactly what your 'I don't know' meant. I never consider myself bound to be truthful, so I beg we may be on equal terms."</p>
<p>\
Cynthia might well say she did not consider herself bound to be truthful; she literally said what came uppermost, without caring very much whether it was accurate or not. But there was no ill-nature, and, in a general way, no attempt at procuring any advantage for herself in all her deviations; and there was often such a latent sense of fun in them that Molly could not help being amused with them in fact, though she condemned them in theory. Cynthia's playfulness of manner glossed such failings over with a kind of charm; and yet, at times, she was so soft and sympathetic that Molly could not resist her, even when she affirmed the most startling things. The little account she made of her own beauty pleased Mr. Gibson extremely; and her pretty deference to him won his heart. She was restless too, till she had attacked Molly's dress, after she had remodelled her mother's.</p>
<p>\
"Now for you, sweet one," said she as she began upon one of Molly's gowns. "I've been working as connoisseur until now; now I begin as amateur."</p>
<p>\
She brought down her pretty artificial flowers, plucked out of her own best bonnet to put into Molly's, saying they would suit her complexion, and that a knot of ribbons would do well enough for her. All the time she worked, she sang; she had a sweet voice in singing, as well as in speaking, and used to run up and down her gay French&nbsp;<em>chansons</em>&nbsp;without any difficulty; so flexible in the art was she. Yet she did not seem to care for music. She rarely touched the piano, on which Molly practised with daily conscientiousness. Cynthia was always willing to answer questions about her previous life, though, after the first, she rarely alluded to it of herself; but she was a most sympathetic listener to all Molly's innocent confidences of joys and sorrows: sympathizing even to the extent of wondering how she could endure Mr. Gibson's second marriage, and why she did not take some active steps of rebellion.</p>
<p>\
In spite of all this agreeable and pungent variety of companionship at home, Molly yearned after the Hamleys. If there had been a woman in that family she would probably have received many little notes, and heard numerous details which were now lost to her, or summed up in condensed accounts of her father's visits at the Hall, which, since his dear patient was dead, were only occasional.</p>
<p>\
"Yes! The Squire is a good deal changed; but he's better than he was. There's an unspoken estrangement between him and Osborne; one can see it in the silence and constraint of their manners; but outwardly they are friendlyâ€”civil at any rate. The squire will always respect Osborne as his heir, and the future representative of the family. Osborne doesn't look well; he says he wants change. I think he's weary of the domestic dullness, or domestic dissension. But he feels his mother's death acutely. It's a wonder that he and his father are not drawn together by their common loss. Roger's away at Cambridge tooâ€”examination for the mathematical tripos. Altogether the aspect of both people and place is changed; it is but natural!"</p>
<p>\
Such is perhaps the summing-up of the news of the Hamleys, as contained in many bulletins. They always ended in some kind message to Molly.</p>
<p>\
Mrs. Gibson generally said, as a comment upon her husband's account of Osborne's&nbsp;melancholy,â€”</p>
<p>\
"My dear! why don't you ask him to dinner here? A little quiet dinner, you know. Cook is quite up to it; and we would all of us wear blacks and lilacs; he couldn't consider that as gaiety."</p>
<p>\
Mr. Gibson took no more notice of these suggestions than by shaking his head. He had grown accustomed to his wife by this time, and regarded silence on his own part as a great preservative against long inconsequential arguments. But every time that Mrs. Gibson was struck by Cynthia's beauty, she thought it more and more advisable that Mr. Osborne Hamley should be cheered up by a quiet little dinner-party. As yet no one but the ladies of Hollingford and Mr. Ashton, the vicarâ€”that hopeless and impracticable old bachelorâ€”had seen Cynthia; and what was the good of having a lovely daughter, if there were none but old women to admire her?</p>
<p>\
Cynthia herself appeared extremely indifferent upon the subject, and took very little notice of her mother's constant talk about the gaieties that were possible, and the gaieties that were impossible, in Hollingford. She exerted herself just as much to charm the two Miss Brownings as she would have done to delight Osborne Hamley, or any other young heir. That is to say, she used no exertion, but simply followed her own nature, which was to attract every one of those she was thrown amongst. The exertion seemed rather to be to refrain from doing so, and to protest, as she often did, by slight words and expressive looks against her mother's words and humoursâ€”alike against her folly and her caresses. Molly was almost sorry for Mrs. Gibson, who seemed so unable to gain influence over her child. One day Cynthia read Molly's thought.</p>
<p>\
"I'm not good, and I told you so. Somehow, I cannot forgive her for her neglect of me as a child, when I would have clung to her. Besides, I hardly ever heard from her when I was at school. And I know she put a stop to my coming over to her wedding. I saw the letter she wrote to Madame Lefevre. A child should be brought up with its parents, if it is to think them infallible when it grows up."</p>
<p>\
"But though it may know that there must be faults," replied Molly, "it ought to cover them over and try to forget their existence."</p>
<p>\
"It ought. But don't you see I have grown up outside the pale of duty and 'oughts.' Love me as I am, sweet one, for I shall never be better."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[As I was perpetually haunted by these ideas, you may imagine that the influence of Woodvilleâ€™s words was very temporary; and that although I did not again accuse him of unkindness, yet I soon became as unhappy as before.

Believe me, my dearest friend, that there is a joy that the sun and earth and all its beauties can bestow that you will one day feel. The refreshing bliss of Love will again visit your heart, and undo the spell that binds you to woe, untill you wonder how your eyes could be closed in the long night that burthens you. I dare not hope that I have inspired you with sufficient interest that the thought of me, and the affection that I shall ever bear you, will soften your melancholy and decrease the bitterness of your tears. But if my friendship can make you look on life with less disgust, beware how you injure it with suspicion. Love is a delicate spriteÂ and easily hurt by rough jealousy. Guard, I entreat you, a firm persuasion of my sincerity in the inmost recesses of your heart out of the reach of the casual winds that may disturb its surface. Your temper is made unequal by suffering, and the tenor of your mind is, I fear, sometimes shaken by unworthy causes; but let your confidence in my sympathy and love be deeper far, and incapable of being reached by these agitations that come and go, and if they touch not your affections leave you uninjured.â€

<p>As I was perpetually haunted by these ideas, you may imagine that the influence of Woodvilleâ€™s words was very temporary; and that although I did not again accuse him of unkindness, yet I soon became as unhappy as before. Soon after this incident we parted. He heard that his mother was ill, and he hastened to her. He came to take leave of me, and we walked together on the heath for the last time. He promised that he would come and see me again; and bade me take cheer, and to encourage what happy thoughts I could, untill time and fortitude should overcome my misery, and I could again mingle in society.</p>
<p>\
â€œAbove all other admonition on my part,â€ he said, â€œcherish and follow this one: do not despair. That is the most dangerous gulph on which you perpetually totter; but you must reassure your steps, and take hope to guide you.&nbsp;Hope, and your wounds will be already half healed: but if you obstinately despair, there never more will be comfort for you. Believe me, my dearest friend, that there is a joy that the sun and earth and all its beauties can bestow that you will one day feel.

<p>\
These were some of Woodvilleâ€™s last lessons. I wept as I listened&nbsp;to him; and after we had taken an affectionate farewell, I followed him far with my eyes until they saw the last of my earthly comforter. I had insisted on accompanying him across the heath towards the town where he dwelt: the sun was yet high when he left me, and I turned my steps towards my cottage. It was at the latter end of the month of September when the nights have become chill. But the weather was serene, and as I walked on I fell into no unpleasing reveries. I thought of Woodville with gratitude and kindness and did not, I know not why, regret his departure with any bitterness. It seemed that after one great shock all other change was trivial to me; and I walked on wondering when the time would come when we should all four, my dearest father restored to me, meet in some sweet Paradise. I pictured to myself a lovely river such as that on whose banks Dante describes Mathilda gathering flowers, which ever flows</p>
<p>\
â€”â€” bruna, bruna,Sotto lâ€™ombra perpetua, che maiRaggiar non lascia sole ivi, nÃ¨ Luna.</p>
<p>\
And then I repeated to myself all that lovely passage that relates the entrance of Dante into the terrestrial Paradise; and thought it would be sweet when I wandered on those lovely banks to see the car of light descend with my long lost parent to be restored to me. As I waited there in expectation of that moment, I thought how, of the lovely flowers that grew there, I would wind myself a chaplet and crown myself for joy: I would sing&nbsp;<em>sul margine dâ€™un rio</em>,&nbsp;my fatherâ€™s favourite song, and that my voice gliding through the windless air would announce to him in whatever bower he sat expecting the moment of our union, that his daughter was come. Then the mark of misery would have faded from my brow, and I should raise my eyes fearlessly to meet his, which ever beamed with the soft lustre of innocent love. When I reflected on the magic look of those deep eyes I wept, but gently, lest my sobs should disturb the fairy scene.</p>
<p>\
I was so entirely wrapt in this reverie that I wandered on, taking no heed of my steps until I actually stooped down to gather a flower for my wreath on that bleak plain where no flower grew, when I awoke from my day dream and found myself I knew not where.</p>
<p>\
The sun had set and the roseate hue which the clouds had caught from him in his descent had nearly died away. A wind swept across the plain, I looked around me and saw no object that told me where I was; I had lost myself, and in vain attempted to find my path. I wandered on, and the coming darkness made every trace indistinct by which I might be guided. At length all was veiled in the deep obscurity of blackest night; I became weary and knowing that my servant was to sleep that night at the neighbouring village, so that my absence would alarm no one; and that I was safe in this wild spot from every intruder, I resolved to spend the night where I was. Indeed I was too weary to walk further: the air was chill but I was careless of bodily inconvenience, and I thought that I was well inured to the weather during my two years of solitude, when no change of seasons prevented my perpetual wanderings.</p>
<p>\
I lay upon the grass surrounded by a darkness which not the slightest beam of light penetratedâ€”There was no sound for the deep night had laid to sleep the insects, the only creatures that lived on the lone spot where no tree or shrub could afford shelter to aught elseâ€”There was a wondrous silence in the air that calmed my senses yet which enlivened my soul, my mind hurried from image to image and seemed to grasp an eternity. All in my heart was shadowy yet calm, untill my ideas became confused and at length died away in sleep.</p>
<p>\
When I awoke it rained:&nbsp;I was already quite wet, and my limbs were stiff and my head giddy with the chill of night. It was a drizzling, penetrating shower; as my dank hair clung to my neck and partly covered my face, I had hardly strength to part with my fingers, the long strait locks that fell before my eyes. The darkness was much dissipated and in the east where the clouds were least dense the moon was visible behind the thin grey cloudâ€”</p>
<p>\
The moon is behind, and at the fullAnd yet she looks both small and dull.</p>
<p>\
Its presence gave me a hope that by its means I might find my home. But I was languid and many hours passed before I could reach the cottage, dragging as I did my slow steps, and often resting on the wet earth unable to proceed.</p>
<p>\
I particularly mark this night, for it was that which has hurried on the last scene of my tragedy, which else might have dwindled&nbsp;on through long years of listless sorrow. I was very ill when I arrived and quite incapable of taking off my wet clothes that clung about me. In the morning, on her return, my servant found me almost lifeless, while possessed by a high fever I was lying on the floor of my room.</p>
<p>\
I was very ill for a long time, and when I recovered from the immediate danger of fever, every symptom of a rapid consumption declared itself. I was for some time ignorant of this and thought that my excessive weakness was the consequence of the fever; <em>sic</em> But my strength became less and less; as winter came on I had a cough; and my sunken cheek, before pale, burned with a hectic fever. One by one these symptoms struck me; &amp; I became convinced that the moment I had so much desired was about to arrive and that I was dying. I was sitting by my fire, the physician who had attended me ever since my fever had just left me, and I looked over his prescription in which digitalis was the prominent medecine. â€œYes,â€ I said, â€œI see how this is, and it is strange that I should have deceived myself so long; I am about to die an innocent death, and it will be sweeter even than that which the opium promised.â€</p>
<p>\
I rose and walked slowly to the window; the wide heath was covered by snow which sparkled under the beams of the sun that shone brightly throâ€™ the pure, frosty air: a few birds were pecking some crumbs under my window.&nbsp;I smiled with quiet joy; and in my thoughts, which through long habit would for ever connect themselves into one train, as if I shaped them into words, I thus addressed the scene before me:</p>
<p>\
â€œI salute thee, beautiful Sun, and thou, white Earth, fair and cold! Perhaps I shall never see thee again covered with green, and the sweet flowers of the coming spring will blossom on my grave. I am about to leave thee; soon this living spirit which is ever busy among strange shapes and ideas, which belong not to thee, soon it will have flown to other regions and this emaciated body will rest insensate on thy bosom</p>
<p>\
â€œRolled round in earthâ€™s diurnal courseWith rocks, and stones, and trees.</p>
<p>\
â€œFor it will be the same with thee, who art called our Universal Mother,&nbsp;when I am gone. I have loved thee; and in my days both of happiness and sorrow I have peopled your solitudes with&nbsp;wild fancies of my own creation. The woods, and lakes, and mountains which I have loved, have for me a thousand associations; and thou, oh, Sun! hast smiled upon, and borne your part in many imaginations that sprung to life in my soul alone, and which will die with me. Your solitudes, sweet land, your trees and waters will still exist, moved by your winds, or still beneath the eye of noon, though&nbsp;what I have felt about ye, and all my dreams which have often strangely deformed thee, will die with me. You will exist to reflect other images in other minds, and ever will remain the same, although your reflected semblance vary in a thousand ways, changeable as the hearts of those who view thee. One of these fragile mirrors, that ever doted on thine image, is about to be broken, crumbled to dust. But everteeming Nature will create another and another, and thou wilt loose nought by my destruction.</p>
<p>\
â€œThou wilt ever be the same. Recieve then the grateful farewell of a fleeting shadow who is about to disappear, who joyfully leaves thee, yet with a last look of affectionate thankfulness. Farewell! Sky, and fields and woods; the lovely flowers that grow on thee; thy mountains &amp; thy rivers; to the balmy air and the strong wind of the north, to all, a last farewell. I shall shed no more tears for my task is almost fulfilled, and I am about to be rewarded for long and most burthensome suffering. Bless thy child even even <em>sic</em> in death, as I bless thee; and let me sleep at peace in my quiet grave.â€</p>
<p>\
I feel death to be near at hand and I am calm. I no longer despair, but look on all around me with placid affection. I find it sweet to watch the progressive decay of my strength, and to repeat to myself, another day and yet another, but again I shall not see the red leaves of autumn; before that time I shall be with my father. I am glad Woodville is not with me for perhaps he would grieve, and I desire to see smiles alone during the last scene of my life; when I last wrote to him I told him of my ill health but not of its mortal tendency, lest he should conceive it to be his duty to come to me for I fear lest the tears of friendship should destroy the blessed calm of my mind. I take pleasure in arranging all the little details which will occur when I shall no longer be. In truth I am in love with death; no maiden ever took more pleasure in the contemplation of her bridal attire than I in fancying my limbs already&nbsp;enwrapt in their shroud: is it not my marriage dress? Alone it will unite me to my father when in an eternal mental union we shall never part.</p>
<p>\
I will not dwell on the last changes that I feel in the final decay of nature. It is rapid but without pain: I feel a strange pleasure in it. For long years these are the first days of peace that have visited me. I no longer exhaust my miserable heart by bitter tears and frantic complaints; I no longer the <em>sic</em> reproach the sun, the earth, the air, for pain and wretchedness. I wait in quiet expectation for the closing hours of a life which has been to me most sweet &amp; bitter. I do not die not having enjoyed life; for sixteen years I was happy: during the first months of my fatherâ€™s return I had enjoyed ages of pleasure: now indeed I am grown old in grief; my steps are feeble like those of age; I have become peevish and unfit for life; so having passed little more than twenty years upon the earth I am more fit for my narrow grave than many are when they reach the natural term of their lives.</p>
<p>\
Again and again I have passed over in my remembrance the different scenes of my short life: if the world is a stage and I merely an actor on it my part has been strange, and, alas! tragical. Almost from infancy I was deprived of all the testimonies of affection which children generally receive; I was thrown entirely upon my own resources, and I enjoyed what I may almost call unnatural pleasures, for they were dreams and not realities. The earth was to me a magic lantern and I a gazer, and a listener but no actor; but then came the transporting and soul-reviving era of my existence: my father returned and I could pour my warm affections on a human heart; there was a new sun and a new earth created to me; the waters of existence sparkled: joy! joy! but, alas! what grief! My bliss was more rapid than the progress of a sunbeam on a mountain, which discloses its glades &amp; woods, and then leaves it dark &amp; blank; to my happiness followed madness and agony, closed by despair.</p>
<p>\
This was the drama of my life which I have now depicted upon paper. During three months I have been employed in this task. The memory of sorrow has brought tears; the memory of happiness a warm glow the lively shadow of that joy. Now my tears are dried; the glow has faded from my cheeks, and with a few words of farewell to you, Woodville, I close my work: the last that I shall perform.</p>
<p>\
Farewell, my only living friend; you are the sole tie that binds me to existence, and now I break it. It gives me no pain to leave you; nor can our seperation give you much. You never regarded me as one of this world, but rather as a being, who for some penance was sent from the Kingdom of Shadows; and she passed a few days weeping on the earth and longing to return to her native soil. You will weep but they will be tears of gentleness. I would, if I thought that it would lessen your regret, tell you to smile and congratulate me on my departure from the misery you beheld me endure. I would say; Woodville, rejoice with your friend, I triumph now and am most happy. But I check these expressions; these may not be the consolations of the living; they weep for their own misery, and not for that of the being they have lost. No; shed a few natural tears due to my memory: and if you ever visit my grave, pluck from thence a flower, and lay it to your heart; for your heart is the only tomb in which my memory will be enterred.</p>
<p>\
My death is rapidly approaching and you are not near to watch the flitting and vanishing of my spirit. Do not regret this; for death is a too terrible an <em>sic</em> object for the living. It is one of those adversities which hurt instead of purifying the heart; for it is so intense a misery that it hardens &amp; dulls the feelings. Dreadful as the time was when I pursued my father towards the ocean, &amp; found their <em>sic</em> only his lifeless corpse; yet for my own sake I should prefer that to the watching one by one his senses fade; his pulse weakenâ€”and sleeplessly as it were devour his life in gazing. To see life in his limbs &amp; to know that soon life would no longer be there; to see the warm breath issue from his lips and to know they would soon be chillâ€”I will not continue to trace this frightful picture; you suffered this torture once; I never did.&nbsp;And the remembrance fills your heart sometimes with bitter despair when otherwise your feelings would have melted into soft sorrow.</p>
<p>\
So day by day I become weaker, and life flickers in my wasting form, as a lamp about to loose it vivifying oil. I now behold the glad sun of May. It was May, four years ago, that I first saw my beloved father; it was in May, three years ago that my folly destroyed the only being I was doomed to love. May is returned, and I die. Three days ago, the anniversary of our meeting; and, alas! of our eternal seperation, after a day of killing emotion, I caused myself to be led once more to behold the face of nature.&nbsp;I caused myself to be carried to some meadows some miles distant from my cottage; the grass was being mowed, and there was the scent of hay in the fields; all the earth looked fresh and its inhabitants happy. Evening approached and I beheld the sun set. Three years ago and on that day and hour it shone through the branches and leaves of the beech wood and its beams flickered upon the countenance of him whom I then beheld for the last time.&nbsp;I now saw that divine orb, gilding all the clouds with unwonted splendour, sink behind the horizon; it disappeared from a world where he whom I would seek exists not; it approached a world where he exists not. Why do I weep so bitterly? Why my <em>sic</em> does my heart heave with vain endeavour to cast aside the bitter anguish that covers it â€œas the waters cover the sea.â€ I go from this world where he is no longer and soon I shall meet him in another.</p>
<p>\
Farewell, Woodville, the turf will soon be green on my grave; and the violets will bloom on it.&nbsp;<em>There</em>&nbsp;is my hope and my expectation; yourâ€™s are in this world; may they be fulfilled.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Jesus fled from Capernaum, and the Galileans at first fell away from him;]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[When I came into Capernaum, I thought to have heard all men rejoicing for that Jesus had not been taken by the Thracians. But, go where I might, I found it quite contrary; for all men were wroth with him for departing. Barabbas was there, and James the son of Judas of Galilee, and many others of the Galilean sect; but I could not have much speech with them, so hot was their anger against Jesus; but on the morrow, lighting upon my cousin Baruch, I questioned him touching that which had happened, and he said thatÂ â€œthe Prophet had turned from him all the hearts of the Galileans because he would not raise up Israel to avenge the death of John.â€

Then I asked how soon they had received tidings of Johnâ€™s death, and he saidÂ â€œYesterday a little before sunset.â€Â I marvelled how the news should have been brought past the Thracians; for, said I,Â â€œthey stayed all travellers from Tiberias, neither suffered they any to pass them.â€Â But Baruch said that James the son of Judas had contrived that lights should be held up each night from Gamala on the other side of the lake, to the intent that the Galileans in Capernaum might know how John fared; and one light should signify that the Prophet lived, but two lights that he lived not.Â â€œAnd,â€Â saidÂ [pg 196]Baruch,Â â€œyestereven before the sun went down, many of the Galileans had gathered together by twos or by threes upon the strand to watch for the signal. And first one light appeared, as was usual; and the men said that it was well, for they had one more day wherein to labour for the Prophetâ€™s deliverance. But then Barabbas cried out that there were two lights; and at first no man would believe it, for (because the sun had not yet set) the lights were not plain to see. But presently Judas also saw the second light, and then they all saw it. Hereupon arose a loud lamentation, and the news spread at once through all the city, and the women began to wail, and the men rushed forth into the streets, and there was a great gathering. Presently with one consent the multitude ran together to the door of the house where Jesus lodged; and first Barabbas went in to ask Jesus to be leader of the host, but soon he came forth again, saying that Jesus would not. Then went in James the son of Judas, saying that he would beseech Jesus in the name of his father, who had fought and died for Israel. With James there went in also three others of the eldest and most reverend of the Galileans, and they remained in the house longer, so that the people thought they had prevailed upon Jesus; and there was a great expectation. But when the elders came out, they showed by their countenances that they had not prevailed.

â€œThenÂ there was much clamour; and the greater part cried out that they would not depart from before the threshold of Jesus till they had persuaded Jesus to be leader of the host; and some cried out to draw him forth by violence and to make him leader of the host. But immediately the door opened, and Jesus himself cameÂ [pg 197]forth. Then they no more talked of violence; but Barabbas and others of the armed men held out their right hands to him, and promised to give up their lives for his sake if he would be their king. Others fell down on their knees before him; and some caught him by the garment to have stayed him. Only James the son of Judas said nothing;Â andÂ it seemed to me,â€Â said Baruch,Â â€œthat at the sight of James, Jesus was more moved than by all the rest. Howbeit he halted not, but moved straight down to the beach.

â€œThen when the people perceived that he would leave them, they cried out even louder than before, and threw dust in the air and poured it upon their heads; and some threw themselves on the ground in his path for to stay him; and some also spared not threatening. But Jesus took no heed thereof, but went still onward with his eyes fast set upon the ground; till one thrust himself before the rest, crying aloud and saying that they would do more for John dead than for Jesus living, and that it was better for a man to lose his life, as John the Prophet had lost it, than to save his life as Jesus desired to save it. Thereat Jesus stayed for an instant, and lifted his eyes from the ground; howbeit not in anger, but rather as he is wont to do (for thou well knowest his manner) whensoever he heareth a Voice of God. But when all the people shouted again, supposing that he had been bent from his purpose, then Jesus beckoned with the hand, and when he had commanded silence, he spake briefly unto them, and said the hour was not yet come; and so he departed.]]></description>

<p>When I came into Capernaum, I thought to have heard all men rejoicing for that Jesus had not been taken by the Thracians. But, go where I might, I found it quite contrary; for all men were wroth with him for departing. Barabbas was there, and James the son of Judas of Galilee, and many others of the Galilean sect; but I could not have much speech with them, so hot was their anger against Jesus; but on the morrow, lighting upon my cousin Baruch, I questioned him touching that which had happened, and he said that&nbsp;â€œthe Prophet had turned from him all the hearts of the Galileans because he would not raise up Israel to avenge the death of John.â€</p>
<p>\
Then I asked how soon they had received tidings of Johnâ€™s death, and he said&nbsp;â€œYesterday a little before sunset.â€&nbsp;I marvelled how the news should have been brought past the Thracians; for, said I,&nbsp;â€œthey stayed all travellers from Tiberias, neither suffered they any to pass them.â€&nbsp;But Baruch said that James the son of Judas had contrived that lights should be held up each night from Gamala on the other side of the lake, to the intent that the Galileans in Capernaum might know how John fared; and one light should signify that the Prophet lived, but two lights that he lived not.&nbsp;â€œAnd,â€&nbsp;said&nbsp;Baruch,&nbsp;â€œyestereven before the sun went down, many of the Galileans had gathered together by twos or by threes upon the strand to watch for the signal. And first one light appeared, as was usual; and the men said that it was well, for they had one more day wherein to labour for the Prophetâ€™s deliverance. But then Barabbas cried out that there were two lights; and at first no man would believe it, for (because the sun had not yet set) the lights were not plain to see. But presently Judas also saw the second light, and then they all saw it. Hereupon arose a loud lamentation, and the news spread at once through all the city, and the women began to wail, and the men rushed forth into the streets, and there was a great gathering. Presently with one consent the multitude ran together to the door of the house where Jesus lodged; and first Barabbas went in to ask Jesus to be leader of the host, but soon he came forth again, saying that Jesus would not. Then went in James the son of Judas, saying that he would beseech Jesus in the name of his father, who had fought and died for Israel. With James there went in also three others of the eldest and most reverend of the Galileans, and they remained in the house longer, so that the people thought they had prevailed upon Jesus; and there was a great expectation. But when the elders came out, they showed by their countenances that they had not prevailed.</p>
<p>\
â€œThen&nbsp;there was much clamour; and the greater part cried out that they would not depart from before the threshold of Jesus till they had persuaded Jesus to be leader of the host; and some cried out to draw him forth by violence and to make him leader of the host. But immediately the door opened, and Jesus himself came&nbsp;forth. Then they no more talked of violence; but Barabbas and others of the armed men held out their right hands to him, and promised to give up their lives for his sake if he would be their king. Others fell down on their knees before him; and some caught him by the garment to have stayed him. Only James the son of Judas said nothing;&nbsp;and&nbsp;it seemed to me,â€&nbsp;said Baruch,&nbsp;â€œthat at the sight of James, Jesus was more moved than by all the rest. Howbeit he halted not, but moved straight down to the beach.</p>
<p>\
â€œThen when the people perceived that he would leave them, they cried out even louder than before, and threw dust in the air and poured it upon their heads; and some threw themselves on the ground in his path for to stay him; and some also spared not threatening. But Jesus took no heed thereof, but went still onward with his eyes fast set upon the ground; till one thrust himself before the rest, crying aloud and saying that they would do more for John dead than for Jesus living, and that it was better for a man to lose his life, as John the Prophet had lost it, than to save his life as Jesus desired to save it. Thereat Jesus stayed for an instant, and lifted his eyes from the ground; howbeit not in anger, but rather as he is wont to do (for thou well knowest his manner) whensoever he heareth a Voice of God. But when all the people shouted again, supposing that he had been bent from his purpose, then Jesus beckoned with the hand, and when he had commanded silence, he spake briefly unto them, and said the hour was not yet come; and so he departed.</p>
<p>\
â€œNow,â€&nbsp;said Baruch,&nbsp;â€œwhile Jesus was speaking to the people, and even afterwards while he was in the&nbsp;sight of the people, it was a marvellous thing to see how still they were; for he hath a power over the hearts of the people so that when he is present no one dare move his tongue against him. But as soon as the boat had rowed away and they could see him no more, straightway Barabbas and his friends began to curse and swear; and they said that they would never again ask aught of Jesus, nor place any faith in him. James the son of Judas said little, but his mind seemed to be the same. For this cause therefore all the Galileans are incensed against Jesus; insomuch that, whereas they had begun to rate him far above John, they now esteem the memory of John more than the presence of Jesus.â€</p>
<p>\
After this, Baruch began to advise me to sever myself from Jesus and to return to my home at Sepphoris, for, said he,&nbsp;â€œHe hath the Pharisees for his enemies; and the richer sort are also estranged from him; and it is commonly reported that Herod the Tetrarch seeketh to slay him with the sword; and now behold, even the Galileans are turned away from him. Now therefore be persuaded, and come back with me to the house of my father Manasseh, and tarry with us for the night, and refresh thyself, and on the morrow set forth for thy home.â€</p>
<p>\
But I made him some fair answer and bade him farewell; for I had determined with myself to take ship that same night, to have sailed over to the other side. But on the morrow, I thought it good (albeit perchance I erred therein) to return first to my mother and to relate to her all that had come to pass, and to bid her farewell: for all men now accounted of Jesus as of one that must either fight or perish: for it could not be that he should live and be honoured of men, and yet not&nbsp;avenge the death of John the Prophet. Wherefore, before I joined myself to a cause that seemed so full of peril, I desired to take leave of my mother.</p>
<p>\
On the fourth day after I was come to Sepphoris, word was brought that Jesus of Nazareth was gathering the people for battle, and that he was making a levy throughout all Galilee, and for this intent had chosen out twelve of his disciples, whom also he called Apostles; and these he had sent out by two and two through the several villages and towns. Jonathan the son of Ezra brought me these tidings; and I was with him next day, walking on the road between Sepphoris and Capernaum, when we met Simon Peter and Andrew.</p>
<p>\
They told us that they had been sent forth by Jesus to proclaim the Kingdom of Heaven, and to drive out unclean spirits, and to heal diseases. They came without wallet, or food, or money, trusting to the alms of the people. But when we questioned them as to the Kingdom, and whether indeed it was to be achieved by force of arms (as the rumour went), or by signs such as fire from heaven and the like: concerning this they knew nothing. As for the healing of diseases, we saw with our own eyes that they had this power; for they healed certain that were sick in Sepphoris, and even cast out three or four unclean spirits.</p>
<p>\
When we had bidden farewell to Simon Peter and Andrew (for they were in haste, passing from place to place like messengers of war) then Jonathan turned to me and said,&nbsp;â€œWhoso pulleth down his old house and doth not first build for himself a new one, is he wise?â€&nbsp;I replied,&nbsp;â€œNay.â€&nbsp;Then said Jonathan,&nbsp;â€œLo, Jesus of Nazareth pulleth down the house of the Law; tell me&nbsp;therefore, what buildeth he in the place thereof?â€&nbsp;I was silent, for I knew not what to answer; but at last I said that Jesus spake of a certain new Spirit which would purify the children of men and enable them to attain righteousness without the Law. But Jonathan said,&nbsp;â€œNay but, my son, can a Spirit tell each man of the children of men, from day to day, what meat he shall eat and what he shall not eat; and when to fast and when to feast; and what to do on the Sabbath day, and what not to do? Now if the Spirit shall tell each man different things, shall there not be a confusion as of Babel? But if the same things, then why should not these things be written in a law? Moreover who shall tell which man hath the Spirit and which hath not? For all will say they have it.â€&nbsp;Then I said that I could not answer those questions, but that I trusted in Jesus of Nazareth as in one sent from God, who could not deceive, neither be deceived, for that his deeds and words were those of a prophet. After this manner I answered; but Jonathan said nothing, but only shook his head a little, as one that doubted more than he hoped.</p>
<p>\
Now on the third day after this discourse (it being, as I remember, the month called Adar, a little after the Feast of Purim), my mother being now completely recovered of her disease, I determined to return to Jesus. For tidings came in daily that all Galilee was ready to rise up when he gave the sign, and I was unwilling to show myself a laggard if matters should come to smiting with the sword. But every day I heard that Jesus was more and more beloved of the people. For all (save only the Pharisees) were now drawn towards him, in that he&nbsp;seemed to be bent upon avenging John the Prophet. And his fame began to be noised abroad through all the country of Galilee and the parts beyond, insomuch that many that had not heard of him before, began to cast in their minds what he could be. And some said that he was Elias. For the common folk, yea, and the Scribes also, were ever expecting that Elias should be sent down to earth, according to the saying of the prophet Malachi. But others said that he was John the Baptist risen from the dead; and this saying was commonly reported, especially among the Gentiles which border on the land of Galilee and in Decapolis, insomuch that Herod himself heard of the rumour, and feared lest it might be even so. But whatsoever men reported about Jesus, in any case his fame waxed very great at this time. For before John was beheaded, the fame of John prevailed over the fame of Jesus in the minds of many; but now all alike, even the disciples of John, looked to Jesus as the avenger of John and as the only Deliverer; insomuch that, at this time, Jesus had both his own fame and also the fame of John the Prophet.</p>
<p>\
I found Jesus in a village about seven miles to the north of Galilee. But when I had saluted him, I noted that he was marvellously changed; yet not so that he was austere, nor even very sad; yet still changed withal, albeit I knew not how nor why. But I had expected that he should have rebuked me for that I had been so long absent, neither had I come to him with all speed so as to be present when first he made the levy in Galilee. Howbeit, he reproved me not; but questioned me kindly touching my motherâ€™s health, and rejoiced when I gave him a good report: but after wards he gave himself again to meditation. When I was come forth from his presence, I asked the disciples concerning the state of Galilee, and what number of men were ready to fight on our side, and when the levy should be made, and the hour for battle should be at hand. But the rest were silent, and Judas alone made answer, that concerning these things the disciples knew nothing; yea, and from certain signs he conjectured that even to Jesus himself the hour of uprising was not yet known, no, nor yet the manner of it, nor the means for it.</p>
<p>\
â€œBut,â€&nbsp;said I,&nbsp;â€œdid not the people in Galilee receive you when ye went forth to proclaim the Redemption?â€&nbsp;â€œYes truly did they,â€&nbsp;said Judas,&nbsp;â€œbut all of the baser sort, and the poor folk which have naught of their own; wherefore they be always ready for warfare.â€&nbsp;â€œAnd what answer made Jesus to your report?â€&nbsp;asked I.&nbsp;â€œTruly a marvellous answer,â€&nbsp;replied Judas,&nbsp;â€œfor when we said that only the poor and simple folk received us, he rejoiced thereat, and thanked God that it was even so.â€&nbsp;â€œNay,â€&nbsp;said I,&nbsp;â€œthat were hard to believe.â€&nbsp;â€œBut yea,â€&nbsp;said Judas;&nbsp;â€œfor his words were these, that he thanked the Father, because He had hidden these things from the wise and the prudent, and revealed them unto babes.â€&nbsp;Then I looked at Nathanael to know whether it was even so, and Nathanael nodded his head, as if to say that it was so.</p>
<p>\
But Judas continued:&nbsp;â€œThis also is not the worst. For he hath not only turned from him the Galileans; but besides, since our flight, whereas there is special need to be busy and striving, behold, these ten days, he museth and meditateth, and ceaseth not. Neither are&nbsp;his musings touching war, nor vengeance, nor military matters; but he broodeth over prophesyings and abstruse matters. And a stranger might go near to think that he had conceived an imagination that, because the Lord hath suffered John the son of Zachariah to die, therefore he must needs die also. But unless he be speedily raised up from this humour of dejection, all is lost.â€</p>
<p>\
He said no more at this time, for Jesus came forth into the court-yard where we sat together around the fountain; and straightway we held our peace. Then we fell to discourse of John the son of Zachariah, how great things he had prophesied, and how we had hoped that he should have triumphed with us in the Kingdom of God; and one likened John unto Elias the prophet, saying that he spake in the spirit of Elias, and that many of the common people would have it that this John was indeed Elias risen from the dead. Then another spake of the love in which the disciples of John the son of Zachariah still had their Master, and how, though he were dead, yet did they still cleave to him in their hearts; insomuch that his spirit seemed to rule over them yet more than his living presence. But another said that John the Prophet could not be Elias: for was it possible that the Lord should suffer such an one as Elias to be slain? And to him Nathanael replied that Isaiah the Prophet was sawn asunder, and wherefore not also Elias? Then Thomas, one of the Twelve, lamented for John the son of Zachariah, because he had been thus swallowed up by destruction, neither had he left children to stand in his stead upon the earth;&nbsp;â€œfor they that die, leaving children behind them,â€&nbsp;said&nbsp;he (quoting a certain proverb of my countrymen)&nbsp;â€œdie not, but only fall asleep: but they that die and leave no children, these die indeed.â€&nbsp;To this John the son of Zebedee made answer that whoso leaveth behind him children perverse and alien from his own nature, he liveth not, for all his children; but whoso leaveth behind him disciples and followers like unto himself and imbued with his own doctrine, such an one liveth, yea even though he be childless and lie in the grave. Hereat methought Jesus was strangely moved: howbeit he sat still where he was, and spake never a word.</p>
<p>\
But presently mention was made of Jonah the Prophet, how that he also was an exile and fled from his country, even as our Master had been forced to flee. Then Judas said that Jonah had done ill to flee, for that none could flee from the presence of the All-seeing, the Maker of all things,&nbsp;â€œfor,â€&nbsp;said he,&nbsp;â€œthe son of man, while he liveth, is like unto a horse tethered by a cord which suffereth him to graze, but resteth still in the hand of his owner.â€&nbsp;Thereon some one took up the discourse and said,&nbsp;â€œNay, but rather the cord is a cord of love, and the owner is not an owner, but a father;â€&nbsp;and another disciple quoted the words of the psalmist,&nbsp;â€œBy thee have I been holden up from the womb.â€&nbsp;Thereat Jesus smiled as if to say that that disciple had spoken well, and he bade John repeat the rest of that same psalm. But when John came, in his repeating, to the words,&nbsp;â€œO God, Thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works,â€&nbsp;then did Jesus seem somewhat moved. But afterwards when John came unto the words,&nbsp;â€œThou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt give me life again, and&nbsp;shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth;â€&nbsp;then indeed the face of Jesus kindled with a marvellous light, and he bade John cease. But he himself sat, still musing, and his lips moved like unto one repeating the same words over and over again:&nbsp;â€œThou shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.â€</p>
<p>\
It came to pass that, about two or three weeks after these things we came to Nazareth, where Jesus was born. Now Jesus had not gone to the place these many days. Some said that he came thither now for to shew unto his mother and his brethren (for his father had been long since dead) that he was sound in health and not possessed nor distraught. Others said that he desired to cause his brethren to believe in him; for at this time they believed not. But others said that he desired to bid farewell to his mother before he went forth to deliver Israel; and to this most people agreed.</p>
<p>\
But when we came to Nazareth, we marvelled that there was so little faith in the men of that place. For they thronged us, as in the other towns, and they were fain to look on Jesus, and called him by&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;names (some being playmates and schoolfellows, some his kinsfolk, and almost all of the number of his acquaintances); moreover they were eager that he should do some mighty work before their eyes; yet could they not believe that he was a prophet, much less that he was the Redeemer of Israel. Neither would they believe that he could drive out evil spirits or heal diseases.</p>
<p>\
Hence it came to pass that Jesus could do no mighty work there. And when they brought unto him many that were sick, and possessed with evil spirits, he looked on them, but perceived that they had not faith to be&nbsp;healed. Wherefore he healed none of them; save only that he laid his hands on a few that were sick of slight diseases and healed them, and even these not without labour. For the same things happened as once in another city, where a man was healed that had been afflicted with a deaf and dumb spirit. For there, because of the manâ€™s want of understanding and lack of faith, Jesus took him apart from the people (for there was a great stir of traffic and of men coming and going), and made signs to him, at the same time touching his ears and his tongue; and he also spake very loud in the manâ€™s ears, not in Greek, but in the language of the Jews (which is used by the poorer people), saying&nbsp;<em>Ephphatha</em>. In this way the man was healed, but only with labour and by degrees. And so it was now, but even worse. Wherefore Jesus himself marvelled at their unbelief.</p>
<p>\
Now the cause of their unbelief was that they knew him from a child. For, said one of them to Jesus himself in my hearing,&nbsp;â€œBehold, these thirty years we have known thy goings out and thy comings in; we have also sat by thy side in the school, and whatsoever thou didst learn we also learned; thou didst play with us at our games round the well; we have seen thee a-working in thy fatherâ€™s house; our couches and our seats are made by thy hand; and shall we call thee the Redeemer of Israel?â€&nbsp;Moreover another bade him come back to the carpenterâ€™s shop; and a third cried out that he had changed trades for the worse, for the Redemption of Israel was a dangerous trade. All these were moved by jealousy, and spake out of the malignity of their hearts.</p>
<p>\
But a certain old Scribe, Josiah the son of Hezekiah, (which also was the chief Scribe of the place, and had known Jesus and loved him of a child) coming forth from his house, met him and fell upon his neck, and blessed him, and embraced him; and then, when he had looked more narrowly at his countenance, he began to mourn over him as if he were his own son, lamenting for that the bloom of beauty had departed from the countenance of Jesus:&nbsp;â€œfor behold,â€&nbsp;said he,&nbsp;â€œsorrow hath driven out the former brightness of thy joy. Thou wast as the dew of the morning, O my lamb, but art become as the parched ground at noontide. Behold, O my lamb, around thy cradle mercy and righteousness joined hands together; and when thou didst sport amid this valley, lo, truth and peace went ever with thee, and thou didst still hold converse with the angels of God? Unfit art thou, O my gentle one, to do battle with the wickedness of wicked men, and with the cunning arts of the adversary. Verily thou wilt be led as a lamb to the slaughter. Hast thou fathomed the depth of the pit of destruction? Or dost thou know by experience the snares of deceit? Return, O thou that art the apple of mine eye, while there is yet time, lest evil befal thee. For I know that danger compasseth thee around, and if thou shalt go hence, thou wilt come back to me no more.â€</p>
<p>\
Jesus spake comfortably to the old man and consoled him; and while he consoled him, his face shone with joy and love; insomuch that the old man also rejoiced, saying that Jesus appeared now again as he appeared in the days of his youth. But still he besought Jesus to return and to avoid contention with the Pharisees, saying that&nbsp;â€œno vessel but peace can hold blessing.â€&nbsp;But Jesus answered him kindly and bade him farewell. And so we departed from Nazareth.</p>
<p>\
When we were now come to the top of the hill which looketh down on Nazareth, we rested a little to recover our breath. Now Jesus was sorrowful because of the unbelief of his kinsfolk and acquaintance, and he was silent (as was his wont when sorrow fell upon him), musing and meditating, and, as it seemed to me, praying; even as one striving to unloose the knot of some hard saying or riddle. For the unbelief of his kinsfolk had filled him with astonishment. While he thus mused, we conversed together, and Judas said that it was an error to have come to Nazareth.&nbsp;â€œFor who knoweth not,â€&nbsp;said he,&nbsp;â€œthat a prophet hath no honour in his own country? For a prophet known is a prophet despised.â€</p>
<p>\
But John the son of Zebedee replied that it was a strange thing that the acquaintance and kinsfolk of Jesus should suppose that they knew the mind and spirit of Jesus because they knew his outward shape and mien and manner of speech:&nbsp;â€œFor his mind and spirit pass knowledge; and the more a man knoweth thereof, the more a man must needs wonder thereat.â€&nbsp;So spake John; but Judas jested at him, and said that John spake as a babe and as a simple clown, knowing nothing of the world.&nbsp;â€œYet,â€&nbsp;added he, looking up at Jesus,&nbsp;â€œit is strange methinks that even our Master should also wonder at that which is in no way wonderful.â€&nbsp;Then John rebuked him and said,&nbsp;â€œKnowest thou not the saying of our Master,&nbsp;â€˜They that wonder shall reign, and they that reign shall rest?â€™&nbsp;Wherefore who knoweth whether it may not be that even our&nbsp;Master day by day learneth some new revelation from God whereat to wonder? For whoso increaseth not diminisheth.â€</p>
<p>\
When I heard these words I looked at Jesus, and behold, it was even as John said. For the sorrow that rested upon his countenance because of the unbelief of his kinsfolk seemed to be passing away, and to be revealing beneath it an exceeding joy, as of one learning some hidden mystery, or hearing some glad tidings. And there came into my mind the words of Barabbas (which were contrary to the words of John), how he said that Jesus did everything with forethought; and behold, both the words of John seemed true and also the words of Barabbas; but the words of John seemed the truer. For though Jesus did naught in haste nor in fear nor perturbation; yet was he not like unto one that seeth all things to come, great and small alike, marked out for him as in a chart, nor like unto him which trusteth in the strength of his own unchangeable will. Nay rather, even as a little child hangeth upon the bosom of his mother and hath no will of his own, even so did Jesus continually look upon earth and heaven and on the deeds and words of men; and, look where he might, he discerned in all things some new knowledge, some revelation concerning the will of the Father in heaven; insomuch that no day passed, yea no hour of the day, but Jesus in this wise held communion with his Father.</p>
<p>\
By this time Jesus was arisen from his seat, and we ceased conversing together when he drew nigh. But Judas, desirous to say somewhat (so as to hide what he had been saying), pointed down to the white houses of&nbsp;Nazareth and to the fields and orchards which compass the city round in the bottom of the valley; and he said to Jesus that the place was exceeding beautiful, like unto a handful of pearls in a goblet of emerald. But Jesus looked narrowly at Judas for an instant, and then down at Nazareth, and then at Judas again; and the sounds of the bleating of the goats and the piping of the shepherds came up to our ears, and the laughter of the children as they sported round the well. When Jesus heard these things, he sighed, and cast his eyes down again on Nazareth, even on the place of his nativity; and he looked at it for a long while very lovingly. Then he turned away his head and departed, and he saw it no more.</p>

I for my part noticed by the sense of sight, before I entered your Kingdom, that some of your people are Lines and others Points, and that some of the Lines are largerâ€”" "You speak of an impossibility," interrupted the King; "you must have seen a vision; for to detect the difference between a Line and a Point by the sense of sight is, as every one knows, in the nature of things, impossible; but it can be detected by the sense of hearing, and by the same means my shape can be exactly ascertained.

"But how," said I, "if a Man feigns a Woman's voice with one of his two voices, or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot be recognized as the echo of the Northern? May not such deceptions cause great inconvenience? And have you no means of checking frauds of this kind by commanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another?"

<h2 id="howivainlytriedtoexplainthenatureofflatland">How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland</h2>
<p>Thinking that it was time to bring down the Monarch from his raptures to the level of common sense, I determined to endeavour to open up to him some glimpses of the truth, that is to say of the nature of things in Flatland. So I began thus: "How does your Royal Highness distinguish the shapes and positions of his subjects? I for my part noticed by the sense of sight, before I entered your Kingdom, that some of your people are Lines and others Points, and that some of the Lines are largerâ€”" "You speak of an impossibility," interrupted the King; "you must have seen a vision; for to detect the difference between a Line and a Point by the sense of sight is, as every one knows, in the nature of things, impossible; but it can be detected by the sense of hearing, and by the same means my shape can be exactly ascertained. Behold meâ€”I am a Line, the longest in Lineland, over six inches of Spaceâ€”" "Of Length", I ventured to suggest. "Fool," said he, "Space is Length. Interrupt me again, and I have done."</p>
<p>\
I apologized; but he continued scornfully, "Since you are impervious to argument, you shall hear with your ears how by means of my two voices I reveal my shape to my Wives, who are at this moment six thousand miles seventy yards two feet eight inches away, the one to the North, the other to the South. Listen, I call to them."</p>
<p>\
He chirruped, and then complacently continued: "My wives at this moment receiving the sound of one of my voices, closely followed by the other, and perceiving that the latter reaches them after an interval in which sound can traverse 6.457 inches, infer that one of my mouths is 6.457 inches further from them than the other, and accordingly know my shape to be 6.457 inches. But you will of course understand that my wives do not make this calculation every time they hear my two voices. They made it, once for all, before we were married. But they COULD make it at any time. And in the same way I can estimate the shape of any of my Male subjects by the sense of sound."</p>
<p>\
"But how," said I, "if a Man feigns a Woman's voice with one of his two voices, or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot be recognized as the echo of the Northern? May not such deceptions cause great inconvenience? And have you no means of checking frauds of this kind by commanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another?" This of course was a very stupid question, for feeling could not have answered the purpose; but I asked with the view of irritating the Monarch, and I succeeded perfectly.</p>
<p>\
"What!" cried he in horror, "explain your meaning." "Feel, touch, come into contact," I replied. "If you mean by FEELING," said the King, "approaching so close as to leave no space between two individuals, know, Stranger, that this offence is punishable in my dominions by death. And the reason is obvious. The frail form of a Woman, being liable to be shattered by such an approximation, must be preserved by the State; but since Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of sight from Men, the Law ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman shall be approached so closely as to destroy the interval between the approximator and the approximated.</p>
<p>\
"And indeed what possible purpose would be served by this illegal and unnatural excess of approximation which you call TOUCHING, when all the ends of so brutal and coarse a process are attained at once more easily and more exactly by the sense of hearing? As to your suggested danger of deception, it is non-existent: for the Voice, being the essence of one's Being, cannot be thus changed at will. But come, suppose that I had the power of passing through solid things, so that I could penetrate my subjects, one after another, even to the number of a billion, verifying the size and distance of each by the sense of FEELING: how much time and energy would be wasted in this clumsy and inaccurate method! Whereas now, in one moment of audition, I take as it were the census and statistics, local, corporeal, mental and spiritual, of every living being in Lineland. Hark, only hark!"</p>
<p>\
So saying he paused and listened, as if in an ecstasy, to a sound which seemed to me no better than a tiny chirping from an innumerable multitude of lilliputian grasshoppers.</p>
<p>\
"Truly," replied I, "your sense of hearing serves you in good stead, and fills up many of your deficiencies. But permit me to point out that your life in Lineland must be deplorably dull. To see nothing but a Point! Not even to be able to contemplate a Straight Line! Nay, not even to know what a Straight Line is! To see, yet be cut off from those Linear prospects which are vouchsafed to us in Flatland! Better surely to have no sense of sight at all than to see so little! I grant you I have not your discriminative faculty of hearing; for the concert of all Lineland which gives you such intense pleasure, is to me no better than a multitudinous twittering or chirping. But at least I can discern, by sight, a Line from a Point. And let me prove it. Just before I came into your kingdom, I saw you dancing from left to right, and then from right to left, with Seven Men and a Woman in your immediate proximity on the left, and eight Men and two Women on your right. Is not this correct?"</p>
<p>\
"It is correct," said the King, "so far as the numbers and sexes are concerned, though I know not what you mean by 'right' and 'left'. But I deny that you saw these things. For how could you see the Line, that is to say the inside, of any Man? But you must have heard these things, and then dreamed that you saw them. And let me ask what you mean by those words 'left' and 'right'. I suppose it is your way of saying Northward and Southward."</p>
<p>\
"Not so," replied I; "besides your motion of Northward and Southward, there is another motion which I call from right to left."</p>
<p>\
KING. Exhibit to me, if you please, this motion from left to right.</p>
<p>\
I. Nay, that I cannot do, unless you could step out of your Line altogether.</p>
<p>\
KING. Out of my Line? Do you mean out of the world? Out of Space?</p>
<p>\
I. Well, yes. Out of YOUR World. Out of YOUR Space. For your Space is not the true Space. True Space is a Plane; but your Space is only a Line.</p>
<p>\
KING. If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by yourself moving in it, then I beg you to describe it to me in words.</p>
<p>\
I. If you cannot tell your right side from your left, I fear that no words of mine can make my meaning clear to you. But surely you cannot be ignorant of so simple a distinction.</p>
<p>\
KING. I do not in the least understand you.</p>
<p>\
I. Alas! How shall I make it clear? When you move straight on, does it not sometimes occur to you that you COULD move in some other way, turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which your side is now fronting? In other words, instead of always moving in the direction of one of your extremities, do you never feel a desire to move in the direction, so to speak, of your side?</p>
<p>\
KING. Never. And what do you mean? How can a man's inside "front" in any direction? Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?</p>
<p>\
I. Well then, since words cannot explain the matter, I will try deeds, and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire to indicate to you.</p>
<p>\
At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland. As long as any part of me remained in his dominion and in his view, the King kept exclaiming, "I see you, I see you still; you are not moving." But when I had at last moved myself out of his Line, he cried in his shrillest voice, "She is vanished; she is dead." "I am not dead," replied I; "I am simply out of Lineland, that is to say, out of the Straight Line which you call Space, and in the true Space, where I can see things as they are. And at this moment I can see your Line, or sideâ€”or inside as you are pleased to call it; and I can see also the Men and Women on the North and South of you, whom I will now enumerate, describing their order, their size, and the interval between each."</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/QIwgKT9OGlSR6PBNKUDEQ387i5H2-vo93xd4.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>When I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly, "Does that at last convince you?" And, with that, I once more entered Lineland, taking up the same position as before.</p>
<p>\
But the Monarch replied, "If you were a Man of senseâ€”though, as you appear to have only one voice I have little doubt you are not a Man but a Womanâ€”but, if you had a particle of sense, you would listen to reason. You ask me to believe that there is another Line besides that which my senses indicate, and another motion besides that of which I am daily conscious. I, in return, ask you to describe in words or indicate by motion that other Line of which you speak. Instead of moving, you merely exercise some magic art of vanishing and returning to sight; and instead of any lucid description of your new World, you simply tell me the numbers and sizes of some forty of my retinue, facts known to any child in my capital. Can anything be more irrational or audacious? Acknowledge your folly or depart from my dominions."</p>
<p>\
Furious at his perversity, and especially indignant that he professed to be ignorant of my sex, I retorted in no measured terms, "Besotted Being! You think yourself the perfection of existence, while you are in reality the most imperfect and imbecile. You profess to see, whereas you can see nothing but a Point! You plume yourself on inferring the existence of a Straight Line; but I CAN SEE Straight Lines, and infer the existence of Angles, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and even Circles. Why waste more words? Suffice it that I am the completion of your incomplete self. You are a Line, but I am a Line of Lines, called in my country a Square: and even I, infinitely superior though I am to you, am of little account among the great nobles of Flatland, whence I have come to visit you, in the hope of enlightening your ignorance."</p>
<p>\
Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry as if to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same moment there arose from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry, increasing in vehemence till at last methought it rivalled the roar of an army of a hundred thousand Isosceles, and the artillery of a thousand Pentagons. Spell-bound and motionless, I could neither speak nor move to avert the impending destruction; and still the noise grew louder, and the King came closer, when I awoke to find the breakfast-bell recalling me to the realities of Flatland.</p>

<h2 id="xiareciprocatingelectricmotor">XI. A RECIPROCATING ELECTRIC MOTOR.</h2>
<p>The electric motor to be treated in this chapter illustrates very prettily the attractive force of a hollow, wire-wound bobbin on a movable core, when the electric current is passed through the wire. If one inserts the end of an iron rod into the coil, the coil exerts a pull upon it, and this pull will cease only when the centre of the rod is opposite the centre of the coil. This principle is used in the â€œelectric gun,â€ which in its simplest form is merely a series of powerful coils arranged one behind another on a tube through which an iron or steel projectile can pass. The projectile closes automatically the circuit of each coil in turn just before reaching it, and breaks it before its centre is halfway through the coil, being thus passed along from one coil to the other with increasing velocity.</p>
<p>\
Our motor is essentially a very inefficient one, its energy being small for the current used, as compared with a revolving motor of the usual kind. But it has the advantage of being very easy to make.</p>
<p>\
[Illustration: FIG. 37.â€”Electric reciprocating engine and battery.]</p>
<p>\
How it works.â€”The experimental engine, constructed in less than a couple of hours, which appears in Fig. 38, consists of a coil, C, strapped down by a piece of tin to a wooden bedplate; a moving plunger, P, mounted on a knitting-needle slide rod, SR; a wire connecting rod, SR; a wooden crank, K; and a piece of knitting-needle for crank shaft, on which are mounted a small eccentric brass wipe, W, and a copper collar, D. Against D presses a brass brush, B1 connected with the binding post, T1; while under W is a long strip of springy brass against which W presses during part of every revolution. T2 is connected to one end of the coil winding, and T1 through a 4-volt accumulator or three dry cells, with the other end of the coil. When W touches B2 the circuit is completed, and the coil draws in the plunger, the contact being broken before the plunger gets home. The crank rotates at a very high speed if there is plenty of battery power, all the moving parts appearing mere blurs.</p>
<h4 id="construction">CONSTRUCTION.</h4>
<p>\
The coil is made by winding 4 oz. of No. 32 cotton-covered wire (price 6d. to 8d.) on a boxwood reel 2 inches long and 1-1/2 inches in diameter, with a 9/16-inch central hole. Before winding, bore a hole for the wire through one end of the reel, near the central part, and mount the reel on a lathe or an improvised spindle provided with a handle of some kind. The wire should be uncoiled and wound on some circular object, to ensure its paying out regularly without kinking; which makes neat winding almost impossible.</p>
<p>\
Draw a foot of the wire through the hole in the reel, and drive in a tiny pegâ€”which must not protrude inwardsâ€”to prevent it slipping. Lay the turns on carefully, forcing them into close contact, so that the next layer may have a level bed. On reaching the end of the layer, be equally careful to finish it neatly before starting back again. When the wire is all on, bore a hole as near the edge of the finishing edge as possible, and draw the spare wire through. Then cut a strip of tough paper of the width of the coils, coat one side with paste, and wrap it tightly round the outside to keep the wire in place.</p>
<p>\
Note.â€”Insulation will be improved if every layer of wire is painted over with shellac dissolved in alcohol before the next layer is applied.</p>
<p>\
Flatten the reel slightly with a file at the points of contact with the baseboard, to prevent rolling.</p>
<p>\
The plunger is a tube of thin iron, 1/16 inch less in diameter than the hole in the reel, and 1/4 inch longer than the reel. If a ready-made tube is not available, construct one by twisting a piece of tin round a metal rod, and soldering the joint. As it is difficult to make a jointed tube cylindrical, and a close fit is needed to give good results, it is worth going to a little trouble to get a plunger of the right kind.</p>
<p>\
The ends of the plunger are plugged with wood and bored centrally for the slide rod, which should not be cut to its final length until the parts are assembled.</p>
<p>\
The crank shaft is 2-3/4 inches of a stout knitting needle mounted in a sheet brass bearing. The crank, a fragment of oak or other tough wood, is balanced, and has a throw of 5/8 inch. The crank-shaft hole should be a trifle small, so that the crank shall get a tight hold of the shaft without pinning. The collar, D, and wipe, W, are soldered to the shaft after this has been passed through its bearings. The brush B1 should press firmly, but not unnecessarily so, against the collar. For B2 one must use very springy brass strip, a piece about 3 inches long and 1/4 inch wide being needed. Bend it to the arc of a large circle, and screw one end down to the base by the binding screw T2. The other end, which should not touch the base, is confined by the heads of a couple of small screws, by means of which the strip is adjusted relatively to the wipe.</p>
<p>\
Fixing the Coil.â€”Cut a strip of tin 1-3/4 inches wide and 4 inches long. Punch a couple of holes near one end, and nail this to the side of the base, with its forward end 4-1/4 inches from the crank shaft. Pass the strip over the coil, and bend it down towards the base. Drill a couple of screw holes, and screw the other end down so that the coil is gripped fairly tight.</p>
<p>\
Fixing the Plunger. Two small guides, G1 G2, are made for the plunger. The holes through which the slide rod moves should be a good fit, and their centres at the level of the centre of the coil. Screw holes are bored in the feet.</p>
<p>\
Pass the plunger through the coil, and place the guides on the rod. Then draw the plunger forward till 1/2 inch projects. Bring G1 close up to it, mark its position, and screw it to the base. The other guide, G2, should be 1-1/2 inches away from the rear of the coil.</p>
<p>\
[Illustration: Fig. 38.â€”Plan of electric reciprocating engine.]</p>
<p>\
The coil and guides must be adjusted so that the plunger does not touch the coil anywhere during a stroke, packings being placed, if necessary, under coil or guides. When the adjustment is satisfactory, screw the coil down tightly, and cut off any superfluous parts of the rod.</p>
<p>\
The Connecting Rod.â€”Bore a hole near the end of the plunger for a screw to hold the rear end of the connecting rod. Pull the plunger out till 1-3/4 inches project, turn the crank full forward, and measure off the distance between the centres of the plunger hole and the crank pin. Drive a couple of wire nails into a board, and twist the ends of a piece of 1/20-inch wire round them twice. This wire constitutes a connecting rod amply strong enough to stand the pulls to which it will be subjected. Fix the rod in position.</p>
<p>\
Adjusting the Wipe.â€”Turn the wipe, W, round until it makes contact with B2, and, holding the crank shaft with a pair of pliers, twist the crank on it till it just begins the return stroke. Then turn the crank to find out how long the wipe remains in contact, and adjust the crank relatively to the wipe so that the crank is vertical when the period of contact is half finished. The length of this period is controlled by the set screws at the free end of B2.</p>
<h4 id="otherdetails">OTHER DETAILS.</h4>
<p>\
The fly wheel may be a disc of wood.</p>
<p>\
Oil all the rubbing parts slightly. Connect T1 to one terminal of the battery, T2 to the coil, and the other terminal of the battery to the coil. Set the engine going. If it refuses to run, make sure that B1 is pressing against D. The speed of the engine may possibly be improved by careful adjustment of B2 and an alteration in the setting of the crank, and will certainly be accelerated by increasing the number of battery cells.</p>
<p>\
The cost of the engine described was about 1s, 3d., exclusive of the battery.</p>

<h2 id="chaptervii">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>Having seen our friend properly installed in his new office, we turned our eyes towards Windsor. The nearness of this place to London was such, as to take away the idea of painful separation, when we quitted Raymond and Perdita. We took leave of them in the Protectoral Palace. It was pretty enough to see my sister enter as it were into the spirit of the drama, and endeavour to fill her station with becoming dignity. Her internal pride and humility of manner were now more than ever at war. Her timidity was not artificial, but arose from that fear of not being properly appreciated, that slight estimation of the neglect of the world, which also characterized Raymond. But then Perdita thought more constantly of others than he; and part of her bashfulness arose from a wish to take from those around her a sense of inferiority; a feeling which never crossed her mind. From the circumstances of her birth and education, Idris would have been better fitted for the formulae of ceremony; but the very ease which accompanied such actions with her, arising from habit, rendered them tedious; while, with every drawback, Perdita evidently enjoyed her situation. She was too full of new ideas to feel much pain when we departed; she took an affectionate leave of us, and promised to visit us soon; but she did not regret the circumstances that caused our separation. The spirits of Raymond were unbounded; he did not know what to do with his new got power; his head was full of plans; he had as yet decided on noneâ€” but he promised himself, his friends, and the world, that the aera of his Protectorship should be signalized by some act of surpassing glory. Thus, we talked of them, and moralized, as with diminished numbers we returned to Windsor Castle. We felt extreme delight at our escape from political turmoil, and sought our solitude with redoubled zest. We did not want for occupation; but my eager disposition was now turned to the field of intellectual exertion only; and hard study I found to be an excellent medicine to allay a fever of spirit with which in indolence, I should doubtless have been assailed. Perdita had permitted us to take Clara back with us to Windsor; and she and my two lovely infants were perpetual sources of interest and amusement.</p>
<p>\
The only circumstance that disturbed our peace, was the health of Adrian. It evidently declined, without any symptom which could lead us to suspect his disease, unless indeed his brightened eyes, animated look, and flustering cheeks, made us dread consumption; but he was without pain or fear. He betook himself to books with ardour, and reposed from study in the society he best loved, that of his sister and myself. Sometimes he went up to London to visit Raymond, and watch the progress of events. Clara often accompanied him in these excursions; partly that she might see her parents, partly because Adrian delighted in the prattle, and intelligent looks of this lovely child.</p>
<p>\
Meanwhile all went on well in London. The new elections were finished; parliament met, and Raymond was occupied in a thousand beneficial schemes. Canals, aqueducts, bridges, stately buildings, and various edifices for public utility, were entered upon; he was continually surrounded by projectors and projects, which were to render England one scene of fertility and magnificence; the state of poverty was to be abolished; men were to be transported from place to place almost with the same facility as the Princes Houssain, Ali, and Ahmed, in the Arabian Nights. The physical state of man would soon not yield to the beatitude of angels; disease was to be banished; labour lightened of its heaviest burden. Nor did this seem extravagant. The arts of life, and the discoveries of science had augmented in a ratio which left all calculation behind; food sprung up, so to say, spontaneouslyâ€”machines existed to supply with facility every want of the population. An evil direction still survived; and men were not happy, not because they could not, but because they would not rouse themselves to vanquish self-raised obstacles. Raymond was to inspire them with his beneficial will, and the mechanism of society, once systematised according to faultless rules, would never again swerve into disorder. For these hopes he abandoned his long-cherished ambition of being enregistered in the annals of nations as a successful warrior; laying aside his sword, peace and its enduring glories became his aimâ€”the title he coveted was that of the benefactor of his country.</p>
<p>\
Among other works of art in which he was engaged, he had projected the erection of a national gallery for statues and pictures. He possessed many himself, which he designed to present to the Republic; and, as the edifice was to be the great ornament of his Protectorship, he was very fastidious in his choice of the plan on which it would be built. Hundreds were brought to him and rejected. He sent even to Italy and Greece for drawings; but, as the design was to be characterized by originality as well as by perfect beauty, his endeavours were for a time without avail. At length a drawing came, with an address where communications might be sent, and no artistâ€™s name affixed. The design was new and elegant, but faulty; so faulty, that although drawn with the hand and eye of taste, it was evidently the work of one who was not an architect. Raymond contemplated it with delight; the more he gazed, the more pleased he was; and yet the errors multiplied under inspection. He wrote to the address given, desiring to see the draughtsman, that such alterations might be made, as should be suggested in a consultation between him and the original conceiver.</p>
<p>\
A Greek came. A middle-aged man, with some intelligence of manner, but with so common-place a physiognomy, that Raymond could scarcely believe that he was the designer. He acknowledged that he was not an architect; but the idea of the building had struck him, though he had sent it without the smallest hope of its being accepted. He was a man of few words. Raymond questioned him; but his reserved answers soon made him turn from the man to the drawing. He pointed out the errors, and the alterations that he wished to be made; he offered the Greek a pencil that he might correct the sketch on the spot; this was refused by his visitor, who said that he perfectly understood, and would work at it at home. At length Raymond suffered him to depart.</p>
<p>\
The next day he returned. The design had been re-drawn; but many defects still remained, and several of the instructions given had been misunderstood. â€œCome,â€ said Raymond, â€œI yielded to you yesterday, now comply with my requestâ€”take the pencil.â€</p>
<p>\
The Greek took it, but he handled it in no artist-like way; at length he said: â€œI must confess to you, my Lord, that I did not make this drawing. It is impossible for you to see the real designer; your instructions must pass through me. Condescend therefore to have patience with my ignorance, and to explain your wishes to me; in time I am certain that you will be satisfied.â€</p>
<p>\
Raymond questioned vainly; the mysterious Greek would say no more. Would an architect be permitted to see the artist? This also was refused. Raymond repeated his instructions, and the visitor retired. Our friend resolved however not to be foiled in his wish. He suspected, that unaccustomed poverty was the cause of the mystery, and that the artist was unwilling to be seen in the garb and abode of want. Raymond was only the more excited by this consideration to discover him; impelled by the interest he took in obscure talent, he therefore ordered a person skilled in such matters, to follow the Greek the next time he came, and observe the house in which he should enter. His emissary obeyed, and brought the desired intelligence. He had traced the man to one of the most penurious streets in the metropolis. Raymond did not wonder, that, thus situated, the artist had shrunk from notice, but he did not for this alter his resolve.</p>
<p>\
On the same evening, he went alone to the house named to him. Poverty, dirt, and squalid misery characterized its appearance. Alas! thought Raymond, I have much to do before England becomes a Paradise. He knocked; the door was opened by a string from aboveâ€”the broken, wretched staircase was immediately before him, but no person appeared; he knocked again, vainlyâ€”and then, impatient of further delay, he ascended the dark, creaking stairs. His main wish, more particularly now that he witnessed the abject dwelling of the artist, was to relieve one, possessed of talent, but depressed by want. He pictured to himself a youth, whose eyes sparkled with genius, whose person was attenuated by famine. He half feared to displease him; but he trusted that his generous kindness would be administered so delicately, as not to excite repulse. What human heart is shut to kindness? and though poverty, in its excess, might render the sufferer unapt to submit to the supposed degradation of a benefit, the zeal of the benefactor must at last relax him into thankfulness. These thoughts encouraged Raymond, as he stood at the door of the highest room of the house. After trying vainly to enter the other apartments, he perceived just within the threshold of this one, a pair of small Turkish slippers; the door was ajar, but all was silent within. It was probable that the inmate was absent, but secure that he had found the right person, our adventurous Protector was tempted to enter, to leave a purse on the table, and silently depart. In pursuance of this idea, he pushed open the door gentlyâ€”but the room was inhabited.</p>
<p>\
Raymond had never visited the dwellings of want, and the scene that now presented itself struck him to the heart. The floor was sunk in many places; the walls ragged and bareâ€”the ceiling weather-stainedâ€”a tattered bed stood in the corner; there were but two chairs in the room, and a rough broken table, on which was a light in a tin candlestick;â€”yet in the midst of such drear and heart sickening poverty, there was an air of order and cleanliness that surprised him. The thought was fleeting; for his attention was instantly drawn towards the inhabitant of this wretched abode. It was a female. She sat at the table; one small hand shaded her eyes from the candle; the other held a pencil; her looks were fixed on a drawing before her, which Raymond recognized as the design presented to him. Her whole appearance awakened his deepest interest. Her dark hair was braided and twined in thick knots like the head-dress of a Grecian statue; her garb was mean, but her attitude might have been selected as a model of grace. Raymond had a confused remembrance that he had seen such a form before; he walked across the room; she did not raise her eyes, merely asking in Romaic, who is there? â€œA friend,â€ replied Raymond in the same dialect. She looked up wondering, and he saw that it was Evadne Zaimi. Evadne, once the idol of Adrianâ€™s affections; and who, for the sake of her present visitor, had disdained the noble youth, and then, neglected by him she loved, with crushed hopes and a stinging sense of misery, had returned to her native Greece. What revolution of fortune could have brought her to England, and housed her thus?</p>
<p>\
Raymond recognized her; and his manner changed from polite beneficence to the warmest protestations of kindness and sympathy. The sight of her, in her present situation, passed like an arrow into his soul. He sat by her, he took her hand, and said a thousand things which breathed the deepest spirit of compassion and affection. Evadne did not answer; her large dark eyes were cast down, at length a tear glimmered on the lashes. â€œThus,â€ she cried, â€œkindness can do, what no want, no misery ever effected; I weep.â€ She shed indeed many tears; her head sunk unconsciously on the shoulder of Raymond; he held her hand: he kissed her sunken tear-stained cheek. He told her, that her sufferings were now over: no one possessed the art of consoling like Raymond; he did not reason or declaim, but his look shone with sympathy; he brought pleasant images before the sufferer; his caresses excited no distrust, for they arose purely from the feeling which leads a mother to kiss her wounded child; a desire to demonstrate in every possible way the truth of his feelings, and the keenness of his wish to pour balm into the lacerated mind of the unfortunate. As Evadne regained her composure, his manner became even gay; he sported with the idea of her poverty. Something told him that it was not its real evils that lay heavily at her heart, but the debasement and disgrace attendant on it; as he talked, he divested it of these; sometimes speaking of her fortitude with energetic praise; then, alluding to her past state, he called her his Princess in disguise. He made her warm offers of service; she was too much occupied by more engrossing thoughts, either to accept or reject them; at length he left her, making a promise to repeat his visit the next day. He returned home, full of mingled feelings, of pain excited by Evadneâ€™s wretchedness, and pleasure at the prospect of relieving it. Some motive for which he did not account, even to himself, prevented him from relating his adventure to Perdita.</p>
<p>\
The next day he threw such disguise over his person as a cloak afforded, and revisited Evadne. As he went, he bought a basket of costly fruits, such as were natives of her own country, and throwing over these various beautiful flowers, bore it himself to the miserable garret of his friend. â€œBehold,â€ cried he, as he entered, â€œwhat birdâ€™s food I have brought for my sparrow on the house-top.â€</p>
<p>\
Evadne now related the tale of her misfortunes. Her father, though of high rank, had in the end dissipated his fortune, and even destroyed his reputation and influence through a course of dissolute indulgence. His health was impaired beyond hope of cure; and it became his earnest wish, before he died, to preserve his daughter from the poverty which would be the portion of her orphan state. He therefore accepted for her, and persuaded her to accede to, a proposal of marriage, from a wealthy Greek merchant settled at Constantinople. She quitted her native Greece; her father died; by degrees she was cut off from all the companions and ties of her youth.</p>
<p>The war, which about a year before the present time had broken out between Greece and Turkey, brought about many reverses of fortune. Her husband became bankrupt, and then in a tumult and threatened massacre on the part of the Turks, they were obliged to fly at midnight, and reached in an open boat an English vessel under sail, which brought them immediately to this island. The few jewels they had saved, supported them awhile. The whole strength of Evadneâ€™s mind was exerted to support the failing spirits of her husband. Loss of property, hopelessness as to his future prospects, the inoccupation to which poverty condemned him, combined to reduce him to a state bordering on insanity. Five months after their arrival in England, he committed suicide.</p>
<p>\
â€œYou will ask me,â€ continued Evadne, â€œwhat I have done since; why I have not applied for succour to the rich Greeks resident here; why I have not returned to my native country? My answer to these questions must needs appear to you unsatisfactory, yet they have sufficed to lead me on, day after day, enduring every wretchedness, rather than by such means to seek relief. Shall the daughter of the noble, though prodigal Zaimi, appear a beggar before her compeers or inferiorsâ€”superiors she had none. Shall I bow my head before them, and with servile gesture sell my nobility for life? Had I a child, or any tie to bind me to existence, I might descend to thisâ€”but, as it isâ€”the world has been to me a harsh step-mother; fain would I leave the abode she seems to grudge, and in the grave forget my pride, my struggles, my despair. The time will soon come; grief and famine have already sapped the foundations of my being; a very short time, and I shall have passed away; unstained by the crime of self-destruction, unstung by the memory of degradation, my spirit will throw aside the miserable coil, and find such recompense as fortitude and resignation may deserve. This may seem madness to you, yet you also have pride and resolution; do not then wonder that my pride is tameless, my resolution unalterable.â€</p>
<p>\
Having thus finished her tale, and given such an account as she deemed fit, of the motives of her abstaining from all endeavour to obtain aid from her countrymen, Evadne paused; yet she seemed to have more to say, to which she was unable to give words. In the mean time Raymond was eloquent. His desire of restoring his lovely friend to her rank in society, and to her lost prosperity, animated him, and he poured forth with energy, all his wishes and intentions on that subject. But he was checked; Evadne exacted a promise, that he should conceal from all her friends her existence in England. â€œThe relatives of the Earl of Windsor,â€ said she haughtily, â€œdoubtless think that I injured him; perhaps the Earl himself would be the first to acquit me, but probably I do not deserve acquittal. I acted then, as I ever must, from impulse. This abode of penury may at least prove the disinterestedness of my conduct. No matter: I do not wish to plead my cause before any of them, not even before your Lordship, had you not first discovered me. The tenor of my actions will prove that I had rather die, than be a mark for scornâ€”behold the proud Evadne in her tatters! look on the beggar-princess! There is aspic venom in the thoughtâ€”promise me that my secret shall not be violated by you.â€</p>
<p>\
Raymond promised; but then a new discussion ensued. Evadne required another engagement on his part, that he would not without her concurrence enter into any project for her benefit, nor himself offer relief. â€œDo not degrade me in my own eyes,â€ she said; â€œpoverty has long been my nurse; hard-visaged she is, but honest. If dishonour, or what I conceive to be dishonour, come near me, I am lost.â€ Raymond adduced many arguments and fervent persuasions to overcome her feeling, but she remained unconvinced; and, agitated by the discussion, she wildly and passionately made a solemn vow, to fly and hide herself where he never could discover her, where famine would soon bring death to conclude her woes, if he persisted in his to her disgracing offers. She could support herself, she said. And then she shewed him how, by executing various designs and paintings, she earned a pittance for her support. Raymond yielded for the present. He felt assured, after he had for awhile humoured her self-will, that in the end friendship and reason would gain the day.</p>
<p>\
But the feelings that actuated Evadne were rooted in the depths of her being, and were such in their growth as he had no means of understanding. Evadne loved Raymond. He was the hero of her imagination, the image carved by love in the unchanged texture of her heart. Seven years ago, in her youthful prime, she had become attached to him; he had served her country against the Turks; he had in her own land acquired that military glory peculiarly dear to the Greeks, since they were still obliged inch by inch to fight for their security. Yet when he returned thence, and first appeared in public life in England, her love did not purchase his, which then vacillated between Perdita and a crown. While he was yet undecided, she had quitted England; the news of his marriage reached her, and her hopes, poorly nurtured blossoms, withered and fell. The glory of life was gone for her; the roseate halo of love, which had imbued every object with its own colour, faded;â€”she was content to take life as it was, and to make the best of leaden-coloured reality. She married; and, carrying her restless energy of character with her into new scenes, she turned her thoughts to ambition, and aimed at the title and power of Princess of Wallachia; while her patriotic feelings were soothed by the idea of the good she might do her country, when her husband should be chief of this principality. She lived to find ambition, as unreal a delusion as love. Her intrigues with Russia for the furtherance of her object, excited the jealousy of the Porte, and the animosity of the Greek government. She was considered a traitor by both, the ruin of her husband followed; they avoided death by a timely flight, and she fell from the height of her desires to penury in England. Much of this tale she concealed from Raymond; nor did she confess, that repulse and denial, as to a criminal convicted of the worst of crimes, that of bringing the scythe of foreign despotism to cut away the new springing liberties of her country, would have followed her application to any among the Greeks.</p>
<p>\
She knew that she was the cause of her husbandâ€™s utter ruin; and she strung herself to bear the consequences. The reproaches which agony extorted; or worse, cureless, uncomplaining depression, when his mind was sunk in a torpor, not the less painful because it was silent and moveless. She reproached herself with the crime of his death; guilt and its punishments appeared to surround her; in vain she endeavoured to allay remorse by the memory of her real integrity; the rest of the world, and she among them, judged of her actions, by their consequences. She prayed for her husbandâ€™s soul; she conjured the Supreme to place on her head the crime of his self-destructionâ€”she vowed to live to expiate his fault.</p>
<p>\
In the midst of such wretchedness as must soon have destroyed her, one thought only was matter of consolation. She lived in the same country, breathed the same air as Raymond. His name as Protector was the burthen of every tongue; his achievements, projects, and magnificence, the argument of every story. Nothing is so precious to a womanâ€™s heart as the glory and excellence of him she loves; thus in every horror Evadne revelled in his fame and prosperity. While her husband lived, this feeling was regarded by her as a crime, repressed, repented of. When he died, the tide of love resumed its ancient flow, it deluged her soul with its tumultuous waves, and she gave herself up a prey to its uncontrollable power.</p>
<p>\
But never, O, never, should he see her in her degraded state. Never should he behold her fallen, as she deemed, from her pride of beauty, the poverty-stricken inhabitant of a garret, with a name which had become a reproach, and a weight of guilt on her soul. But though impenetrably veiled from him, his public office permitted her to become acquainted with all his actions, his daily course of life, even his conversation. She allowed herself one luxury, she saw the newspapers every day, and feasted on the praise and actions of the Protector. Not that this indulgence was devoid of accompanying grief. Perditaâ€™s name was for ever joined with his; their conjugal felicity was celebrated even by the authentic testimony of facts. They were continually together, nor could the unfortunate Evadne read the monosyllable that designated his name, without, at the same time, being presented with the image of her who was the faithful companion of all his labours and pleasures.&nbsp;<em>They</em>,&nbsp;<em>their Excellencies</em>, met her eyes in each line, mingling an evil potion that poisoned her very blood.</p>
<p>\
It was in the newspaper that she saw the advertisement for the design for a national gallery. Combining with taste her remembrance of the edifices which she had seen in the east, and by an effort of genius enduing them with unity of design, she executed the plan which had been sent to the Protector. She triumphed in the idea of bestowing, unknown and forgotten as she was, a benefit upon him she loved; and with enthusiastic pride looked forward to the accomplishment of a work of hers, which, immortalized in stone, would go down to posterity stamped with the name of Raymond. She awaited with eagerness the return of her messenger from the palace; she listened insatiate to his account of each word, each look of the Protector; she felt bliss in this communication with her beloved, although he knew not to whom he addressed his instructions. The drawing itself became ineffably dear to her. He had seen it, and praised it; it was again retouched by her, each stroke of her pencil was as a chord of thrilling music, and bore to her the idea of a temple raised to celebrate the deepest and most unutterable emotions of her soul. These contemplations engaged her, when the voice of Raymond first struck her ear, a voice, once heard, never to be forgotten; she mastered her gush of feelings, and welcomed him with quiet gentleness.</p>
<p>\
Pride and tenderness now struggled, and at length made a compromise together. She would see Raymond, since destiny had led him to her, and her constancy and devotion must merit his friendship. But her rights with regard to him, and her cherished independence, should not be injured by the idea of interest, or the intervention of the complicated feelings attendant on pecuniary obligation, and the relative situations of the benefactor, and benefited. Her mind was of uncommon strength; she could subdue her sensible wants to her mental wishes, and suffer cold, hunger and misery, rather than concede to fortune a contested point. Alas! that in human nature such a pitch of mental discipline, and disdainful negligence of nature itself, should not have been allied to the extreme of moral excellence! But the resolution that permitted her to resist the pains of privation, sprung from the too great energy of her passions; and the concentrated self-will of which this was a sign, was destined to destroy even the very idol, to preserve whose respect she submitted to this detail of wretchedness.</p>
<p>\
Their intercourse continued. By degrees Evadne related to her friend the whole of her story, the stain her name had received in Greece, the weight of sin which had accrued to her from the death of her husband. When Raymond offered to clear her reputation, and demonstrate to the world her real patriotism, she declared that it was only through her present sufferings that she hoped for any relief to the stings of conscience; that, in her state of mind, diseased as he might think it, the necessity of occupation was salutary medicine; she ended by extorting a promise that for the space of one month he would refrain from the discussion of her interests, engaging after that time to yield in part to his wishes. She could not disguise to herself that any change would separate her from him; now she saw him each day. His connection with Adrian and Perdita was never mentioned; he was to her a meteor, a companionless star, which at its appointed hour rose in her hemisphere, whose appearance brought felicity, and which, although it set, was never eclipsed. He came each day to her abode of penury, and his presence transformed it to a temple redolent with sweets, radiant with heavenâ€™s own light; he partook of her delirium. â€œThey built a wall between them and the worldâ€â€”Without, a thousand harpies raved, remorse and misery, expecting the destined moment for their invasion. Within, was the peace as of innocence, reckless blindless, deluding joy, hope, whose still anchor rested on placid but unconstant water.</p>
<p>\
Thus, while Raymond had been wrapt in visions of power and fame, while he looked forward to entire dominion over the elements and the mind of man, the territory of his own heart escaped his notice; and from that unthought of source arose the mighty torrent that overwhelmed his will, and carried to the oblivious sea, fame, hope, and happiness.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With bitcoinâ€™s price breaking above $30,000, the cryptosphere seems locked in a â€œbull or bear marketâ€ conflict.</p>
<p>Bitcoinâ€™s price keeps going up but it feels like a bear market.</p>
<p>Leading indicators and social media tell you the world's about to fall off a cliff but your friends think everything's OK.</p>
<p>Bearish analysts turned into bulls but nothing substantively has changed except the price.</p>
<p>YouTube tells you cryptoâ€™s about to explode but Ethereumâ€™s still down against bitcoin and your altcoins havenâ€™t gone up yet.</p>
<p>We're in the disbelief stage of the Wall Street cheat sheet.</p>
<p><img src="https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FehtGzSIGZx4cmpmgYoGu1.png&w=3840&q=75" alt="" /></p>
<p>Does that mean weâ€™re in a bull market?</p>
<p>That's up to you. You get to decide.</p>
<h1 id="allthesametome">All the same to me</h1>
<p>Bitcoin crashes 30 to 50% regularly during bull markets and pumps 100 to 300% regularly during bear markets.</p>
<p>Its price goes above and below the so-called â€œbull market support bandâ€ all the time, as you can see on this chart (the ribbon is the bull market support band).</p>
<p><img src="https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FV-QzEGQhkppfUYW-mZgHR.png&w=3840&q=75" alt="" /></p>
<p>Whether you decide itâ€™s a bull market or a bear market, does that necessarily mean anything for your decisions?</p>
<p>If bitcoinâ€™s price stays above $15,600, weâ€™ve been in a bull market for almost a year.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it will take a long timeâ€”possibly yearsâ€”before we will know whether we are in a bull market or not.</p>
<p>Take advantage of opportunities as they come so you can squeeze the most juice out of the market. This is a long-term, upward-trending asset class with massive tailwinds and plenty of room to grow. Donâ€™t fight it!</p>
<h1 id="reliefrallybulltrapechobubble">Relief rally, bull trap, echo bubble</h1>
<p><em>Mark, a recessionâ€™s coming, the World Bank said global GDP will contract, mortgage rates are crazy, nobody can afford a house, negative amortization, commercial real estate, China collapsing, wars, inflation, etc. Youâ€™re buying into the echo bubble bull trap final exit pump!</em></p>
<p>Weâ€™ll get a recession and a global contraction. Everybody knows that.</p>
<p>As long-time readers know, Iâ€™ve been preparing for this since the end of 2021, when the US reached full employment. A recession always happens within five years after the US economy reaches full employment. 100% of the time, guaranteed. Since 1970, that recession has come within three years, every single time.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, your government decides itâ€™s not in a recession, as the US did after it had two consecutive quarters of negative growth in 2022. That used to be the definition of â€œrecession,â€ but the US government nixed that definition of recession a few years ago.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s the new definition?</p>
<p>\</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œA significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few monthsâ€¦Notably, there are no fixed rules or thresholds that trigger a determination of decline.â€</p>
  <p>â€”The White House</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\
So . . . under this definition, the US may never have another recession ever again! You could be waiting for an event that never happens,&nbsp;<em>even if the economy collapses.</em></p>
<p>Thatâ€™s very helpful for economists. At the beginning of 2022, they said a recession would come in the second half of that year. When that didnâ€™t happen, they moved it to the first half of this year. Now, theyâ€™re targeting the first half of next year. Maybe theyâ€™ll push it to 2025.</p>
<p>When economists can move the goalposts at will and your government can define a recession however it wants, do you really need to fuss and worry about dates, times, or prices? Do you need to be so tactical?</p>
<h1 id="yourpriceisnotprice">Your price is not price</h1>
<p>At what price should you worry? At what price should you get excited?</p>
<p>None. Prices are meaningless.</p>
<p>Two years ago, mid-2021, $30,000 bitcoin terrified you. People said the bear market had already started. Bitcoin finished the year 50% higher.</p>
<p>One year ago, just before the FTX collapse, $30,000 seemed like a pipe dream, a bullâ€™s fantasy. YouTube told you to sell before everything falls apart. Now, youâ€™d kill for those prices.</p>
<p>Six months ago, after the first big pump of 2023, $30,000 looked like the last stop before $1 million. Bitcoin would save us from Credit Suisse and the collapse of the US banking system. Within two months, the price dropped 25% lower.</p>
<p>Today, $30,000 seems like an opportunity to sell before the inevitable collapse to $14,000 or lower. â€œTheyâ€™re not going to fool me again!â€</p>
<p>Sometimes, $30,000 is just $30,000.</p>
<h1 id="atriptorektcity">A trip to rekt city</h1>
<p>Just take the market as it comes and make the best of it.</p>
<p>Youâ€™re already down 50% from holding your governmentâ€™s currency instead of bitcoin. How much more will you risk losing while you wait for â€œthe bull market to be confirmed?â€</p>
<p>Also, donâ€™t assume that you're going to make money once that bull market comes. In 2021, bitcoinâ€™s price went up 60% but most people ended the year down on their investment.</p>
<p>If you used the safe, effective strategy of dollar cost averagingâ€”putting in fixed amounts at fixed intervals regardless of market conditionsâ€”you finished negative on the year.</p>
<p><em>In the middle of a raging bull market.</em></p>
<p>From 2018 to 2020, people stayed out of crypto because â€œitâ€™s a bear market.â€ Bitcoinâ€™s price went up 350% from bottom to the supposed start of the bull market.</p>
<p><img src="https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FviCaqbrk1GXLz6rIHvQm4.png&w=3840&q=75" alt="" /></p>
<p>Its price went up another 350% from the start of the â€œbull marketâ€ to the peak. At the very worst, you performed as well in the bear market as the bull market. More than likely, you came away 3x better than anybody who waited for the bull market to start.</p>
<p>Why obsess over it?</p>
<p>Donâ€™t get wrapped up in the bull/bear conflict. Leave the stress and worry to others.</p>
<p>One day, they may discover that â€œbullâ€ and â€œbearâ€ markets donâ€™t even matter.</p>

<h2 id="chapterviiithetelephone">Chapter VIII. THE TELEPHONE.</h2>
<p>The Bell telephoneâ€”The Edison transmitterâ€”The granular carbon transmitterâ€”General arrangement of a telephone circuitâ€”Double-line circuitsâ€”Telephone exchangesâ€”Submarine telephony.</p>
<p>\
FOR&nbsp;the purposes of everyday life the telephone is even more useful than the telegraph. Telephones now connect one room of a building with another, house with house, town with town, country with country. An infinitely greater number of words pass over the telephonic circuits of the world in a year than are transmitted by telegraph operators. The telephone has become an important adjunct to the transaction of business of all sorts. Its wires penetrate everywhere. Without moving from his desk, the London citizen may hold easy converse with a Parisian, a New Yorker with a dweller in Chicago.</p>
<p>\
Wonderful as the transmission of signals over great&nbsp;distances is, the transmission of human speech so clearly that individual voices may be distinguished hundreds of miles away is even more so. Yet the instrument which works the miracle is essentially simple in its principles.</p>
<p>\
THE BELL TELEPHONE.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ydPx2Ff17fMY5tvVcxlLTOSw9il1-2023-10-25T01:45:01.184Z-rvltqx1traf22upsrhr0ij73" alt="&nbsp;Fig. 62.â€”Section of a Bell telephone." /></p>
<p>\
The first telephone that came into general use was that of Bell, shown in Fig. 62. In a central hole of an ebonite casing is fixed a permanent magnet,&nbsp;m. The casing expands at one end to accommodate a coil of insulated wire wound about one extremity of a magnet. The coil ends are attached to wires passing through small channels to terminals at the rear. A circular diaphragm,&nbsp;d, of very thin iron plate, clamped between the concave mouthpiece and the casing, almost touches the end of the magnet.</p>
<p>\
We will suppose that two Bell telephones, A and B, are connected up by wires, so that the wires and the coils form a complete circuit. Words are spoken into A. The air vibrations, passing through the central hole in the cover, make the diaphragm vibrate towards and away from the magnet. The distances through which the diaphragm moves have been measured, and found not to exceed in some cases more than&nbsp;1â„10,000,000&nbsp;of an inch! Its movements distort the shape of the "lines of force" emanating from the magnet, and these, cutting through the turns of the coil, induce a current in the line circuit. As the diaphragm approaches the magnet a circuit is sent in one direction; as it leaves it, in the other. Consequently speech produces rapidly alternating currents in the circuit, their duration and intensity depending on the nature of the sound.</p>
<p>\
Now consider telephone B. The currents passing through its coil increase or diminish the magnetism of the magnet, and cause it to attract its diaphragm with varying force. The vibration of the diaphragm disturbs the air in exact accordance with the vibrations of A's diaphragm, and speech is reproduced.</p>
<p>\
THE EDISON TRANSMITTER.</p>
<p>\
The Bell telephone may be used both as a transmitter and a receiver, and the permanent magnetism of the cores renders it independent of an electric battery. But currents generated by it are so minute that they cannot overcome the resistance of a long circuit; therefore a battery is now always used, and with it a special device as transmitter.</p>
<p>\
If in a circuit containing a telephone and a battery there be a loose contact, and this be shaken, the varying resistance of the contact will cause electrical currents of varying force to pass through the circuit. Edison introduced the first successful&nbsp;<em>microphone</em>&nbsp;transmitter, in which a small platinum disc connected to the diaphragm pressed with varying force against a disc of carbon, each disc forming part of the circuit. Vibrations of the diaphragm caused current to flow in a series of rapid pulsations.</p>
<p>\

<p>\
THE GRANULAR CARBON TRANSMITTER.</p>
<p>\
In Fig. 63 we have a section of a microphone transmitter now very widely used. It was invented, in its original form, by an English clergyman named Hunnings. Resting in a central cavity of an ebonite seating is a carbon block,&nbsp;c, with a face moulded into a number of pyramidal projections,&nbsp;p p. The space between&nbsp;c&nbsp;and a carbon diaphragm,&nbsp;d, is packed with carbon granules,&nbsp;g g.&nbsp;c&nbsp;has direct contact with line terminal&nbsp;t, which screws into it;&nbsp;d&nbsp;with&nbsp;t1&nbsp;through the brass casing, screw&nbsp;s, and a small plate at the back of the transmitter. Voice vibrations compress&nbsp;g g, and allow current to pass&nbsp;more freely from&nbsp;d&nbsp;to&nbsp;c. This form of microphone is very delicate, and unequalled for long-distance transmission.</p>
<p>\

<p>\
GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF A TELEPHONE CIRCUIT.</p>
<p>\
In many forms of subscriber's instruments both receiver and transmitter are mounted on a single handle in such a way as to be conveniently placed for ear and mouth. For the sake of clearness the diagrammatic&nbsp;sketch of a complete installation (Fig. 64) shows them separated. The transmitters, it will be noticed, are located in battery circuits, including the primary windings&nbsp;p p2&nbsp;of induction coils. The transmitters are in the line circuit, which includes the secondary windings&nbsp;s s2&nbsp;of the coils.</p>
<p>\
We will assume that the transmitters are, in the first instance, both hung on the hooks of the metallic switches, which their weight depresses to the position indicated by the dotted lines. The handle of the magneto-generator at the left-end station is turned, and current passes through the closed circuit:â€”Line&nbsp;a,&nbsp;e b2, contact 10, the switch 9; line&nbsp;b, 4, the other switch, contact 5, and&nbsp;e b. Both bells ring. Both parties now lift their receivers from the switch hooks. The switches rise against contacts 1, 2, 3 and 6, 7, 8 respectively. Both primary and both secondary circuits are now completed, while the bells are disconnected from the line wires. The pulsations set up by transmitter&nbsp;t&nbsp;in primary coil&nbsp;p&nbsp;are magnified by secondary coil&nbsp;s&nbsp;for transmission through the line circuit, and affect both receivers. The same thing happens when&nbsp;t2&nbsp;is used. At the end of the conversation the receivers are hung on their hooks again, and the bell circuit is remade, ready for the next call.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ydPx2Ff17fMY5tvVcxlLTOSw9il1-2023-10-25T01:45:01.187Z-njhwtw9z5tak24c4wse8xq5v" alt="A TELEPHONE EXCHANGE." /></p>
<p>\
DOUBLE-LINE CIRCUITS.</p>
<p>\
The currents used in telephones pulsate very rapidly, but are very feeble. Electric disturbances caused by the proximity of telegraph or tram wires would much interfere with them if the earth were used for the return circuit. It has been found that a complete metallic circuit (two wires) is practically free from interference, though where a number of wires are hung on the same poles, speech-sounds may be faintly induced in one circuit from another. This defect is, however, minimized by crossing the wires about among themselves, so that any one line does not pass round the corresponding insulator on every pole.</p>
<p>\
TELEPHONE EXCHANGES.</p>
<p>\
In a district where a number of telephones are used the subscribers are put into connection with one another through an "exchange," to which all the wires lead. One wire of each subscriber runs to a common "earth;" the other terminates at a switchboard presided over by an operator. In an exchange used by many subscribers the terminals are distributed over a number of switchboards, each containing 80 to 100 terminals, and attended to by an operator, usually a girl.</p>
<p>\
When a subscriber wishes to be connected to another subscriber, he either turns the handle of a magneto generator, which causes a shutter to fall and expose his number at the exchange, or simply depresses a key which works a relay at the exchange and lights a tiny electric lamp. The operator, seeing the signal, connects her telephone with the subscriber's circuit and asks the number wanted. This given, she rings up the other subscriber, and connects the two circuits by means of an insulated wire cord having a spike at each end to fit the "jack" sockets of the switchboard terminals. The two subscribers are now in communication.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ydPx2Ff17fMY5tvVcxlLTOSw9il1-5i93qcs.jpeg" alt="Fig. 65.â€”The headdress of an operator at a telephone exchange. The receiver is fastened over one ear, and the transmitter to the chest." /></p>
<p>\
If a number on switchboard A calls for a number on switchboard C, the operator at A connects her subscriber by a jack cord to a trunk line running&nbsp;to C, where the operator similarly connects the trunk line with the number asked for, after ringing up the subscriber. The central exchange of one town is connected with that of another by one or more trunk lines, so that a subscriber may speak through an indefinite number of exchanges. So perfect is the modern telephone that the writer remembers on one occasion hearing the door-bell ring in a house more than a hundred miles away, with which he was at the moment in telephonic connection, though three exchanges were in the circuit.</p>
<p>\
SUBMARINE TELEPHONY.</p>
<p>\
Though telegraphic messages are transmitted easily through thousands of miles of cable,&nbsp;submarine telephony is at present restricted to comparatively short distances. When a current passes through a cable, electricity of opposite polarity induced on the outside of the cable damps the vibration in the conductor. In the Atlantic cable, strong currents of electricity are poured periodically into one end, and though much enfeebled when they reach the other they are sufficiently strong to work a very&nbsp;delicate "mirror galvanometer" (invented by Lord Kelvin), which moves a reflected ray up and down a screen, the direction of the movements indicating a dot or a dash. Reversible currents are used in transmarine telegraphy. The galvanometer is affected like the coils and small magnet in Wheatstone's needle instrument.</p>
<p>\
Telephonic currents are too feeble to penetrate many miles of cable. There is telephonic communication between England and France, and England and Ireland. But transatlantic telephony is still a thing of the future. It is hoped, however, that by inserting induction coils at intervals along the cables the currents may be "stepped up" from point to point, and so get across. Turning to Fig. 64, we may suppose&nbsp;s&nbsp;to be on shore at the English end, and&nbsp;s2&nbsp;to be the&nbsp;<em>primary</em>&nbsp;winding of an induction coil a hundred miles away in the sea, which magnifies the enfeebled vibrations for a journey to&nbsp;s3, where they are again revived; and so on, till the New World is reached. The difficulty is to devise induction coils of great power though of small size. Yet science advances nowadays so fast that we may live to hear words spoken at the Antipodes.</p>

<h2 id="internalcombustionengines">INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES</h2>
<p>OIL ENGINES â€” ENGINES WORKED WITH PRODUCER GAS â€” BLAST FURNACE GAS ENGINES</p>
<p>\
If carbon and oxygen be made to combine chemically, the process is accompanied by the phenomenon called heat. If heat be applied to a liquid or gas in a confined space it causes a violent separation of its molecules, and power is developed.</p>
<p>\
In the case of a steam-engine the fuel is coal (carbon in a more or less pure form), the fluid, water. By burning the fuel under a boiler, a gas is formed which, if confined, rapidly increases the pressure on the walls of the confining vessel. If allowed to pass into a cylinder, the molecules of steam, struggling to get as far as possible from one another, will do useful work on a piston connected by rods to a revolving crank.</p>
<p>\
We here see the combustion of fuel external to the cylinder, i.e. under the boiler, and the fuel and fluid kept apart out of actual contact. In the gas or oil-vapour engine the fuel is brought into contact with the fluid which does the work, mixed with it, and burnt inside the cylinder. Therefore these engines are termed internal combustion engines.</p>
<p>\
Supposing that a little gunpowder were placed in a cylinder, of which the piston had been pushed almost as far in as it would go, and that the powder were fired by electricity. The charcoal would unite with the oxygen contained in the saltpetre and form a large volume of gas. This gas, being heated by the ignition, would instantaneously expand and drive out the piston violently.</p>
<p>\
A very similar thing happens at each explosion of an internal combustion engine. Into the cylinder is drawn a charge of gas, containing carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, and also a proportion of air. This charge is squeezed by the inward movement of the piston; its temperature is raised by the compression, and at the proper moment it is ignited. The oxygen and carbon seize on one another and burn (or combine), the heat being increased by the combustion of the hydrogen. The air atoms are expanded by the heat, and work is done on the piston. But the explosion is much gentler than in the case of gunpowder.</p>
<p>\
During recent years the internal combustion engine has been making rapid progress, ousting steam power from many positions in which it once reigned supreme. We see it propelling vehicles along roads and rails, driving boats through the water, and doing duty in generating stations and smelting works to turn dynamos or drive air-pumpsâ€”not to mention the thousand other forms of usefulness which, were they enumerated here, would fill several pages.</p>
<p>\
A decade ago an internal combustion engine of 100 h.p. was a wonder; to-day single engines are built to develop 3,000 h.p., and in a few years even this enormous capacity will doubtless be increased.</p>
<p>\
It is interesting to note that the rival systemsâ€”gas and steamâ€”were being experimented with at the same time by Robert Street and James Watt respectively. While Watt applied his genius to the useful development of the power latent in boiling water, Street, in 1794, took out letters patent for an engine to be worked by the explosions caused by vaporising spirits of turpentine on a hot metal surface, mixing the vapour with air in a cylinder, exploding the mixture, and using the explosion to move a piston. In his, and subsequent designs, the mixture was pumped in from a separate cylinder under slight pressure. Lenoir, in 1860, conceived the idea of making the piston suck in the charge, so abolishing the need of a separate pump; and many engines built under his patents were long in use, though, if judged by modern standards, they were very wasteful of fuel. Two years later Alphonse Beau de Rochas proposed the further improvement of utilising the cylinder, not only as a suction pump, but also as a compressor; since he saw that a compressed mixture would ignite very much more readily than one not under pressure. Rochas held the secret of success in his grasp, but failed to turn it to practical account. The "Otto cycle," invented by Dr. Otto in 1876, is really only Rochas's suggestion materialised. The large majority of internal combustion engines employ this "cycle" of operations, so we may state its exact meaning:â€”</p>
<p>\
(1) A mixture of explosive gas and air is drawn into the cylinder by the piston as it passes outwards (i.e. in the direction of the crank), through the inlet valve.</p>
<p>\
(2) The valve closes, and the returning piston compresses the mixture.</p>
<p>\
(3) The mixture is fired as the piston commences its second journey outwards, and gives the "power" stroke.</p>
<p>\
(4) The piston, returning again, ejects the exploded mixture through the outlet or exhaust valve, which began to open towards the end of the third stroke.</p>
<p>\
Briefly stated, the "cycle" isâ€”suction, compression, explosion, expulsion; one impulse being given during each cycle, which occupies two complete revolutions of the fly-wheel. Since the first, second, and third operations all absorb energy, the wheel must be heavy enough to store sufficient momentum during the "power" stroke to carry the piston through all its three other duties.</p>
<p>\
Year by year, the compression of the mixture has been increased, and improvements have been made in the methods of governing the speed of the engine, so that it may be suitable for work in which the "load" is constantly varying. By doubling, trebling, and quadrupling the cylinders the drive is rendered more and more steady, and the elasticity of a steam-engine more nearly approached.</p>
<p>\
The internal combustion engine has "arrived" so late because in the earlier part of last century conditions were not favourable to its development. Illuminating gas had not come into general use, and such coal gas as was made was expensive. The great oil-fields of America and Russia had not been discovered. But while the proper fuels for this type of motor were absent, coal, the food of the steam-engine, lay ready to hand, and in forms which, though useless for many purposes, could be advantageously burnt under a boiler.</p>
<p>\
Now the situation has altered. Gas is abundant; and oil of the right sort costs only a few pence a gallon. Inventors and manufacturers have grasped the opportunity. To-day over 3,000,000 h.p. is developed continuously by the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>\
Steam would not have met so formidable a rival had not that rival had some great advantages to offer. What are these? Well, first enter a factory driven by steam power, and carefully note what you see. Then visit a large gas- or oil-engine plant. You will conclude that the latter scores on many points. There are no stokers required. No boilers threaten possible explosions. The heat is less. The dust and dirt are less. The space occupied by the engines is less. There is no noisome smoke to be led away through tall and expensive chimneys. If work is stopped for an hour or a day, there are no fires to be banked or drawnâ€”involving waste in either case.</p>
<p>\
Above all, the gas engine is more efficient, or, if you like to express the same thing in other words, more economical. If you use only one horse-power for one hour a day, it doesn't much matter whether that horse-power-hour costs 4d. or 5d. But in a factory where a thousand horse-power is required all day long, the extra pence make a big total. If, therefore, the proprietor finds that a shilling's-worth of gas or oil does a quarter as much work again as a shilling's-worth of coal, and that either form of fuel is easily obtained, you may be sure that, so far as economy is concerned, he will make up his mind without difficulty as to the class of engine to be employed. A pound of coal burnt under the best type of steam-engine gives but 10 per cent. of its heating value in useful work. A good oil-engine gives 20-25 per cent., and in special types the figures are said to rise to 35-40 per cent. We may notice another point, viz. that, while a steam-engine must be kept as hot as possible to be efficient, an internal combustion engine must be cooled. In the former case no advantage, beyond increased efficiency, results. But in the latter the water passed round the cylinders to take up the surplus heat has a value for warming the building or for manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>\
Putting one thing with another, experts agree that the explosion engine is the prime mover of the future. Steam has apparently been developed almost to its limit. Its rival is but half-grown, though already a giant.</p>
<p>\
Some internal combustion engines use petroleum as their fuel, converting it into gas before it is mixed with air to form the charge; others use coal-gas drawn from the lighting mains; "poor gas" made in special plants for power purposes; or natural gas issuing from the ground. Natural gas occurs in very large quantities in the United States, where it is conveyed through pipes under pressure for hundreds of miles, and distributed among factories and houses for driving machinery, heating, and cooking. In England and Europe the petroleum engine and coal-gas engine have been most utilised; but of late the employment of smelting-furnace gasesâ€”formerly blown into the air and wastedâ€”and of "producer" gas has come into great favour with manufacturers. The latest development is the "suction" gas engine, which makes its own gas by drawing steam and air through glowing fuel during the suction stroke.</p>
<p>\
We will consider the various types under separate headings devoted</p>
<p>\
(1) To the oil-fuel engine,</p>
<p>\
(2) The producer-gas engine and the suction-gas engine,</p>
<p>\
(3) Blast-furnace gas engines,</p>
<p>with reference to the installations used in connection with the last two.</p>
<p>\
All explosion engines (excepting the very small types employed on motor cycles) have a water-jacket round the cylinders to absorb some of the heat of combustion, which would otherwise render the metal so hot as to make proper lubrication impossible, and also would unduly expand the incoming charge of gas and air before compression. The ideal engine would take in a full charge of cold mixture, which would receive no heat from the walls of the cylinder, and during the explosion would pass no heat through the walls. In other words, the ideal metal for the cylinders would be one absolutely non-receptive of heat. In the absence of this, engineers are obliged to make a compromise, and to keep the cylinder at such a temperature that it can be lubricated fittingly, while not becoming so cold as to absorb too much of the heat of explosion.</p>
<p>\
OIL ENGINES</p>
<p>These fall into two main classes:â€”</p>
<p>\
(a) Those using light, volatile, mineral oilsâ€”such as petrol and benzolineâ€”and alcohol, a vegetable product.</p>
<p>\
(b) Those using heavy oils, such as paraffin oil (kerosene) and the denser constituents of rock-oil left in the stills after the kerosene has been driven off. American petroleum is rich in burning-oil and petrol; Russian in the very heavy residue, called astakti. Given the proper apparatus for vaporisation, mineral oils of any density can be used in the explosion engine.</p>
<p>\
The first class is so well known as the mover of motor vehicles and boats that we need not linger here on it. It may, however, be remarked that engines using the easily-vaporised oils are not of large powers, since the fuel is too expensive to make them valuable for installations where large units of power are needed. They have been adopted for locomotives on account of their lightness, and the ease with which they can be started. Petrol vaporises at ordinary temperatures, so that air merely passed over the spirit absorbs sufficient vapour to form an explosive mixture. The "jet" carburetter, now generally employed, makes the mixture more positive by atomising the spirit as it passes through a very fine nozzle into the mixing chamber under the suction from the cylinder. On account of their small size spirit engines work at very high speeds as compared with the large oil or gas engine. Thus, while a 2,000 h.p. KÃ¶rting gas engine develops full power at eighty-five revolutions a minute, the tiny cycle motor must be driven at 2,000 to 3,000 revolutions. Speaking generally, as the size increases the speed decreases.</p>
<p>\
Of heavy oil engines there are some dozens of well-tried types. They differ in their methods of effecting the following operations.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The feeding of the oil fuel to the engine.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The conversion of the oil into vapour.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The ignition of the charge.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The governing of speed.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All these engines have a vaporiser, or chamber wherein the oil is converted into gas by the action of heat. When starting-up the engine, this chamber must be heated by a specially designed lamp, similar in principle to that used by house painters for burning old paint off wood or metal.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the operations enumerated above in some detail.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The oil supply. Fuel is transferred from the storage tank to the vaporiser either by the action of gravity through a regulating device to prevent "flooding," or by means of a small pump, or by the suction of the piston, which lifts the liquid. In some engines the air and gas enter the cylinder through a single valve; in others through separate valves.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Vaporisation. As already remarked, the vaporising chamber must be heated to start the engine. When work has begun the lamp may be removed if the engine is so designed that the chamber stores up sufficient heat in its walls from each explosion to vaporise the charge for the next power stroke. The Crossley engine has a lamp continuously burning; the Hornsby-Ackroyd depends upon the storage of heat from explosions in a chamber opening into the cylinder. The best designs are fairly equally divided between the two systems.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Ignition of the compressed charge is effected in one of four ways: by bringing the charge, at the end of the compression stroke, into contact with a closed tube projecting from the cylinder and heated outside by a continuously burning lamp; by the heat stored in some part of the combustion chamber (i.e. that portion of the cylinder not swept by the piston); by an electric spark; or by the mere heat of compression. The second and third methods are confined to comparatively few makes; and the Diesel Oil Engine (of which more presently) has a monopoly of the fourth.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Governing. All engines which turn machinery doing intermittent workâ€”such as that of a sawmill, or electric generating plant connected with a number of motorsâ€”must be very carefully guarded from overrunning. Imagine the effect on an engine which is putting out its whole strength and getting full charges of fuel, if the belt suddenly slipped off and it were "allowed its head." A burst fly-wheel would be only one of the results. The steam-engine is easily controlled by the centrifugal action of a ball-governor, which, as the speed increases, gradually spreads its balls and lifts a lever connected with a valve in the steam supply pipe. Owing to its elastic nature, steam will do useful work if admitted in small quantities to the cylinder. But a difficulty arises with the internal combustion engine if the supply of mixture is similarly throttled, because a loss of quantity means loss of compression and bad ignition. Many oil engines are therefore governed by apparatus which, when the speed exceeds a certain limit, cuts off the supply altogether, either by throwing the oil-pump temporarily out of action, or by lifting the exhaust valve so that the movement of the piston causes no suctionâ€”the "hit-and-miss" method, as it is called.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The means adopted depends on the design of the engine; and it must be said that, though all the devices commonly used effect their purpose, none are perfect; this being due rather to the nature of an internal explosion engine than to any lack of ingenuity on the part of inventors. The steadiest running is probably given with the throttle control, which diminishes the supply. On motor cars this method has practically ousted the "hit-and-miss" governed exhaust valve; but in stationary engines we more commonly find the speed controlled by robbing the mixture of the explosive gas in inverse proportion to the amount of the work required from the engine.</p>
<p>\
THE DIESEL OIL ENGINE,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ydPx2Ff17fMY5tvVcxlLTOSw9il1-wkb3x1d.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>\
The Diesel differs from other internal combustion engines in the following respects:â€”</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It works with very much higher compression.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The ignition is spontaneous, resulting from the high compression of the charge alone.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The fuel is not admitted into the cylinder until the power-stroke begins, and enters in the form of a fine spray.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The combustion of the fuel is much slower, and therefore gives a more continuous and elastic push to the piston.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The engine works on the ordinary Otto cycle. To start it, air compressed in a separate vessel is injected into the cylinder. The piston flies out, and on its return squeezes the air to about 500 lbs. to the square inch, thus rendering it incandescent.[11] Just as the piston begins to move out again a valve in the cylinder-head opens, and a jet of pulverised oil is squirted in by air compressed to 100 lbs. per square inch more than the pressure in the cylinder. The vapour, meeting the hot air, burns, but comparatively slowly: the pressure in the cylinder during the stroke decreasing much more gradually than in other engines. Governing is effected by regulation of the amount of oil admitted into the cylinder.</p>
<p>\
In spite of its high compression this engine runs with very little vibration. The writer saw a penny stand unmoved on its edge on the top of a cylinder in which the piston was reciprocating 500 times a minute!</p>
<p>\
ENGINES WORKED BY PRODUCER-GAS</p>
<p>These engines are worked by a special gas generated in an apparatus called a "producer." If air is forced through incandescent carbon in a closed furnace its oxygen unites with the carbon and forms carbonic acid gas, known chemically as CO2, because every molecule of the gas contains one atom of carbon and two of oxygen. This gas, being the product of combustion, cannot burn (i.e. combine with more oxygen), but as it passes up through the glowing coke, coal, or other fuel, it absorbs another carbon atom into every molecule, and we have C2O2, or 2 CO, which we know as carbon monoxide. This gas may be seen burning on the top of an open fire with a very pale blue flame, as it once more combines with oxygen to form carbonic acid gas.</p>
<p>\
The carbon monoxide is valuable as a heating agent, and when mixed with air forms an explosive mixture.</p>
<p>\
If along with the air sent into our furnace there goes a proportion of steam, further chemical action results. The oxygen of the steam combines with carbon to form carbon monoxide, and sets free the hydrogen. The latter gas, when it combines with oxygen in combustion, causes intense heat; so that if from the furnace we can draw off carbon monoxide and hydrogen, we shall be able to get a mixture which during combustion will set up great heat in the cylinder of an engine.</p>
<p>\
In 1878 Mr. Emerson Dowson invented an apparatus for manufacturing a gas suitable for power plant, the gas being known as Producer or Poor Gas, the last term referring to its poorness in hydrogen as compared with coal and other gases. While the hydrogen is a desirable ingredient in an explosive charge, it must not form a large proportion, since under compression it renders the mixture in which it takes part dangerously combustible, and liable to spontaneous ignition before the piston has finished the compression stroke. Water-gas, very rich in hydrogen, and made by a very similar process, is therefore not suitable for internal combustion engines.</p>
<p>\
There are many types of producers, but they fall under two main heads, i.e. the pressure and the suction.</p>
<p>\
The pressure producer contains the following essential parts:â€”</p>
<p>\
The generator, a vertical furnace fed from the top through an air-tight trap, and shut off below from the outside atmosphere by having its foot immersed in water. Any fuel or ashes which fall through the bars into the water can be abstracted without spoiling the draught. Air and steam are forced into the generator, and pass up through the fuel with the chemical results already described. The gases then flow into a cooler, enclosed in a water-jacket, through which water circulates, and on into a scrubber, where they must find their way upwards through coke kept dripping with water from overhead jets. The water collects impurities of all sorts, and the gas is then ready for storage in the gas-holders or for immediate use in the engines.</p>
<p>\
A pound of anthracite coal thus burnt will yield enough gas to develop 1 h.p. for one hour.</p>
<p>\
Suction Gas Plants.â€”With these gas is not stored in larger quantities than are needed for the immediate work of the engine. In fact, the engine itself during its suction strokes draws air and steam through a very small furnace, coolers, and scrubbers direct into the cylinder. The furnace is therefore fed with air and water, not by pressure from outside, but by suction from inside, hence the name "suction producer." At the present time suction gas engines are being built for use on ships, since a pound of fuel thus consumed will drive a vessel further than if burnt under a steam boiler. Very possibly the big ocean liners of twenty years hence may be fitted with such engines in the place of the triple and quadruple expansion steam machinery now doing the work.</p>
<p>\
BLAST-FURNACE GAS ENGINES</p>
<p>Every iron blast-furnace is very similar in construction and action to the generator of a producer-gas plant. Into it are fed through a hopper, situated in the top, layers of ore, coal or coke, and limestone. At the bottom enters a blast of air heated by passing through a stove of firebrick raised to a high temperature by the carbon monoxide gas coming off from the furnace. When the stove has been well heated the gas supply is shut off from it and switched to the engine-house to create power for driving the huge blowers.</p>
<p>\
The gas contains practically no hydrogen, as the air sent through the furnace is dry; but since it will stand high compression, it is very suitable for use in large engines. Formerly all the gas from the furnace was expelled into the open air and absolutely wasted; then it was utilised to heat the forced draught to the furnace; next, to burn under boilers; and last of all, at the suggestion of Mr. B. H. Thwaite, to operate internal combustion engines for blowing purposes. Thus, in the fitness of things, we now see the biggest gas engines in the world installed where gas is created in the largest quantities, and an interesting cycle of actions results. The engine pumps the air; the air blows the furnace and melts the iron out of the ore; the furnace creates the gas; the gas heats the air or works the engines to pump more air. So engines and furnace mutually help each other, instead of all the obligation being on the one side.</p>
<p>\
When, a few years ago, the method was first introduced, engines were damaged by the presence of dust carried with the gas from the furnace. Mr. B. H. Thwaite has, however, perfected means for the separation of injurious matter, and blast-furnace gas is coming into general use in England and on the Continent. Some idea of the power which has been going to waste in ironworks for decades past may be gathered from a report of Professor Hubert after experiments made in 1900. He says that engines of large size do not use more than 100 cubic feet of average blast-furnace gas per effective horse-power-hour, which is less than one-fourth of the consumption of gas required to develop the same power from boilers and good modern condensing steam-engines, so that there is an immense surplus of power to be obtained from a blast-furnace if the blowing engines are worked by the gas it generates, a surplus which can be still further increased if the gas is properly cleaned. It is estimated that for every 100 tons of coke used in an ordinary Cleveland [128]blast-furnace, after making ample allowance for gas for the stoves and power for the lifts, pumps, etc., and for gas for working the necessary blowing engines, there is a surplus of at least 1,500 h.p.; so that by economising gas by cleaning, and developing the necessary power by gas engines, every furnace owner would have a very large surplus of power for his steel or other works, or for selling in the form of electricity or otherwise.</p>
<p>\
Yet all this gas had been formerly turned loose for the breezes to warm their fingers at! Truly, as an observant writer has recorded, the sight of a special plant being put up near a blast furnace to manufacture gas for the blowing engines suggests the pumping of water uphill in order to get water-power!</p>
<p>\
Messrs. Westgarth and Richardson, of Middlesbrough; the John Cockerill Company, of Seraing, Belgium; and the De la Vergne Company, of New York, are among the chief makers of the largest gas engines in the world, ranging up to 3,750 h.p. each. These immense machines, some with fly-wheels 30 feet in diameter, and cylinders spacious enough for a man to stand erect in, work blowers for furnaces or drive dynamos. At the works of the manufacturers mentioned the engines helped to make the steel, and turn the machinery for the creation of brother monsters.</p>

<p>\
This use of a "bye-product" of industry is remarkable, but it can be paralleled. Furnace slag, once cast away as useless, is now recognised to be a valuable manure, or is converted into bricks, tiles, cement, and other building materials. Again, the former waste from the coal-gas purifier assumes importance as the origin of aniline dyes, creosote, saccharine, ammonia, and oils. We really appear to be within sight of the happy time when waste will be unknown. And it therefore is curious that we still burn gas as an illuminant, when the same, if made to work an engine, would give more lighting power in the shape of electric current supplying incandescent lamps.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="ensuringyourlandingpagespeakstoyouraudience">Ensuring Your Landing Page Speaks to Your Audience</h2>
<p>Your landing page's success is contingent upon its ability to engage and prompt action from your audience. One crucial aspect to consider is that you are not your customer. What resonates with you, in terms of images, words, and design, may not necessarily appeal to your target audience.</p>
<p>\
So, what makes a landing page effective? It should adhere to landing page best practices, which involve structuring your content, utilizing compelling visual elements, and conducting user testing.</p>
<h2 id="letsdelveintotheselandingpagebestpractices">Let's Delve Into These Landing Page Best Practices:</h2>
<h3 id="structuringyourcontent">Structuring Your Content:</h3>
<p>Effective landing pages follow a structured content hierarchy. This means that your unique selling proposition (USP) should be prominently displayed at the top of the page, often within the main or supporting headline. Additional components typically include:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlighting key benefits of your product or service.</li>
<li>Providing social proof, such as customer reviews.</li>
<li>Delivering a Concise and Persuasive Call to Action (CTA).</li>
</ul>
<p>\
Given that website visitors spend an average of <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/chartbeat-website-engagement-data-nj">just 54 seconds</a> on a webpage, it's crucial to convey your message concisely. Avoid excessive text and prioritize creating an exceptional headline and supporting headline:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your headline brief and explicit about your USP.</li>
<li>Ensure that your supporting headline is also concise, either elaborating on the main headline or offering a secondary USP.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usingvisualelements">Using Visual Elements:</h3>
<p>The human brain processes images <a href="https://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better">60,000 times faster than text</a>, with people retaining 80% of what they see compared to <a href="https://medium.com/@iDashboards_UK/on-average-people-remember-only-20-of-what-they-read-but-80-of-what-they-see-8411224769e2">20% of what they read</a>. </p>
<p>\
Visual elements, such as images, illustrations, infographics, animations, and videos, are invaluable for conveying your USP, demonstrating value, providing social proof, and educating visitors.</p>
<h3 id="testingeverything">Testing Everything:</h3>
<p>Even if your landing page follows best practices, there's no guarantee of success. Marketers and designers often rely on assumptions and personal biases, making user testing crucial for gaining real insights. User testing allows you to validate your text, images, and design decisions with actual users, offering a deeper understanding than analytics alone. </p>
<p>\
It answers the "why" behind user behavior, enabling adjustments to your landing page, such as its structure, content, and imagery, before going live.</p>
<p>\
User testing doesn't require extensive resources and can be conducted at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. It's a key tool for data-backed decision-making, offering access to authentic insights within hours and a setup that takes mere minutes.</p>
<p>\
Incorporating user messaging obtained through testing empowers you to optimize your landing page's conversion rate, making it accessible to organizations of all sizes.</p>
<h3 id="evaluatingyouruserinterfaceuidesign">Evaluating Your User Interface (UI) Design</h3>
<p>User Interface (UI) design is integral to creating an appealing and user-friendly digital experience. Successful UI designs are easy to navigate, read, and lead users to take desired actions. To achieve this, it's crucial to align your thinking with your users' expectations.</p>
<h2 id="herearefourcommonuierrorstoavoidandkeyfixes">Here Are Four Common UI Errors to Avoid and Key Fixes:</h2>
<h3 id="toomuchtext">Too Much Text:</h3>
<p>Users tend to skim content, looking for information relevant to them. Overloading with text can lead to confusion. Ensure your text is clear, concise, and broken into manageable chunks, making it easier for users to absorb.</p>
<h3 id="cluttereddesign">Cluttered Design:</h3>
<p>Complex design elements, including excessive font styles and layouts, can distract users. Maintain a consistent design style, use one or two font styles, and keep the layout uncluttered for ease of navigation.</p>
<h3 id="headlineswithoutamessage">Headlines Without a Message:</h3>
<p>Headlines are among the first elements users notice. They should be eye-catching, concise, and relevant to the content that follows. Long, dull, or misleading headlines can drive users away. Incorporate humor, keyword targeting, and relevance to engage users.</p>
<h3 id="ineffectivecalltoactioncta">Ineffective Call to Action (CTA):</h3>
<p>Your CTA should be prominent, clearly visible, and explicitly state the desired action. Ensure CTA buttons stand out against the background and are surrounded by white space. The CTA should logically follow the content and design elements on the page, preparing users for the next step.</p>
<p>\
To evaluate the effectiveness of your UI design, usability testing is essential. It provides valuable data on how real users from your target audience interact with your site or app. </p>
<p>\
By conducting usability testing, you can gain quantitative and qualitative insights, enabling you to identify strengths and areas in need of improvement in just a few days. </p>
<p>\
This approach helps eliminate UI errors and enhance the user experience, ultimately attracting more customers.</p>
<p>\
In conclusion, adopting these best practices for landing page design and UI design can significantly improve user engagement and conversion rates. </p>
<p>\
Conducting user testing and usability testing provides valuable insights and ensures your digital assets effectively resonate with your target audience.</p>
<h2 id="boostingemailconversionshowtowriteengagingemails">Boosting Email Conversions: How to Write Engaging Emails</h2>
<p>You've meticulously curated an email list filled with high-value prospects. Your email campaigns are well-crafted and intriguing. The good news is that the analytics show your emails are being delivered and opened, which is a positive start. </p>
<p>\
However, the not-so-good news is that your click-through and conversion rates remain disappointingly low. So, what's the next step?</p>
<p>\
<a href="https://mailchimp.com/fr/resources/email-marketing-benchmarks/">According to Mailchimp</a>, the average email click-through rate hovers around 2.62 percent across all industries, with a 21 percent open rate. If your figures fall below these industry benchmarks, your email campaign is missing something crucial.</p>
<h2 id="alowemailclickthroughratectrcanbeattributedtovariousreasons">A Low Email Click-Through Rate (Ctr) Can Be Attributed to Various Reasons:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Unclear call-to-action messages.</p></li>
<li><p>Emails sent to the wrong recipients.</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient email personalization.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of incentives to click on links.</p></li>
<li><p>Poor timing for email delivery.</p></li>
<li><p>Subpar content layout.</p></li>
<li><p>Excessive links within the email.</p></li>
<li><p>Inappropriate tone in the email.</p></li>
<li><p>Overemphasis on sales in every message.</p></li>
<li><p>Overuse of stop words.</p></li>
<li><p>Providing too much information in the email.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The list of potential issues goes on, and remarkably, a single one of these mistakes can deter recipients from engaging with your email. Email marketing is remarkably sensitive to these nuances, making it vital to identify and correct your missteps. This is where user testing plays a pivotal role.</p>
<h2 id="emailtestingidentifyingandaddressingissues">Email Testing: Identifying and Addressing Issues</h2>
<p>User testing offers valuable insights into why your marketing emails have low click-through rates. Utilizing a dedicated user validation platform designed to provide marketers and product designers with actionable insights from the consumer's perspective is a powerful way to gain these insights.</p>
<p>\
You can conduct user tests on your entire email campaign, run A/B tests with multiple email variations, or assess the impact of email content on your readers. The choice of test depends on your goals and your position in the marketing journey.</p>
<p>\
An unbiased user test provides valuable insights into what your audience likes or dislikes about your marketing emails, which directly influences their willingness to click on links and buttons within the email. </p>
<p>\
Subsequently, you can make necessary adjustments to your email content to ensure it resonates effectively.</p>
<h2 id="thespecifictweakswilldependonthetestresultsherearesomeemailmarketingtipstoconsiderapplying">The Specific Tweaks Will Depend on the Test Results. Here Are Some Email Marketing Tips to Consider Applying:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update your email list to include more relevant targets.</li>
<li>Optimize email content for maximum impact.</li>
<li>Revise your email marketing strategy to create a goal-oriented customer journey.</li>
<li>Eliminate unnecessary distractions from email content.</li>

<h2 id="thesentenceanditselements">THE SENTENCE AND ITS ELEMENTS</h2>
<p>In the preceding chapters we have seen words as they are used singly. We studied their pronunciation and the way in which they were formed to express a definite meaning. In this chapter we shall begin a review of grammar, a study of words not according to their pronunciation or their definition, but according to their use as they are arranged with other words to express complete ideas. The simplest group into which words are thus arranged is the sentence, consisting of two important parts, the subject and the predicate. The subject is the part about which something is told, and the predicate is the part that tells about the subject; as,</p>
<p>| <em>Subject</em> | <em>Predicate</em> |
|----|----|
| The sun | shines brightly |</p>
<p>\
There are several different kinds of sentences, named according to the meaning which they express. They are as follows:</p>
<p>\
The&nbsp;<em>declarative</em> sentence states a fact. \n The <em>interrogative</em> sentence asks a question. \n The <em>imperative</em> sentence commands or entreats. \n The <em>exclamatory</em> sentence expresses deep feeling.</p>
<p>\n <em>Illustrations</em></p>
<p>*Declarative: *John closed the door. \n *Interrogative: *Did John close the door? \n *Imperative: *Close the door. \n *Exclamatory: *What a noise the door made! \n </p>
<p>Sentences are classified, also, according to their structure or form. If a sentence has one subject and one predicate, it is a&nbsp;<em>simple</em>&nbsp;sentence. If it is made up of two independent parts, it is a&nbsp;<em>compound</em>&nbsp;sentence. If it has one independent part and one or more dependent parts, each of which contains a subject and a predicate of its own, the sentence is&nbsp;<em>complex</em>. The independent part of the sentence is called a&nbsp;<em>principal clause</em>, and the dependent part is called a&nbsp;<em>subordinate clause</em>. A&nbsp;<em>phrase</em>&nbsp;is also a dependent part of a sentence, but it differs from a subordinate clause in that it contains no subject or predicate. Both phrases and subordinate clauses are used as parts of speech, as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. Thus we have the following definitions:</p>
<p>\
A&nbsp;<em>simple</em>&nbsp;sentence contains one principal clause.</p>
<p>\
A&nbsp;<em>compound</em>&nbsp;sentence contains two or more principal clauses.</p>
<p>\
A&nbsp;<em>complex</em>&nbsp;sentence contains one principal clause and one or more subordinate clauses.</p>
<p>\
A phrase is a group of related words used as a part of speech. (See Exercises 68 and 69.)</p>
<p>\
A clause is a group of words containing a subject and a predicate. A subordinate clause is used as a part of speech. It usually has an introductory word to distinguish it from a principal clause. (See Exercise 71.)</p>
<p>\
Illustrations Simple sentence: To-day most of the world's big questions are business questions. Complex sentence: The view that business is only humdrum routine and sordid money-making needs revising, since most of the world's big questions are business questions. Compound sentence: Many people still belittle business, calling it humdrum routine and sordid money-making, but this view needs revising.</p>
<p>\
Phrase:           (a) of the world's big questions.
(b) calling it humdrum routine and sordid money-making.
Subordinate clause: (a) that business is only humdrum routine and sordid money-making.
(b) since most of the world's big questions are business questions.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Exercise 59</strong>
Write two of each of the following kinds of sentences: a. Declarative, b. Interrogative, c. Imperative, d. Exclamatory.</p>
<p>\
Examine each of the sentences below and tell</p>
<p>\
a. Whether it is simple, complex, or compound.</p>
<p>\
b. Its subject and its predicate.</p>
<p>\
c. Its phrases and its subordinate clause (if there are any).</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Exercise 60â€”Sentence Errors</strong></p>
<p>\
S. 1. The Baby Blunder.â€”In writing, one of the most elementary forms of correctness is shown in the proper division into sentences. The ability instinctively to end a sentence at the right place is called the "sentence sense." Students who do not possess it or who have not learned the difference between sentences, subordinate clauses, and phrases frequently make the mistake of setting off too much or too little for one sentence. For example, they run two sentences together as one; as,</p>
<p>\
Wrong: Motor wagons are economical, department stores of all large cities are acquiring them.</p>
<p>\
The sentence, as written above, contains one form of the sentence errorâ€”one of the worst possible mistakes in writing. It is sometimes called the comma fault or the baby blunder. For brevity we shall call it S 1 (sentence error number one). Motor wagons are economical is a principal clause. Department stores of all large cities are acquiring them is also a principal clause. Two such clauses may not stand in the same sentence separated only by a comma. To correct, divide into two sentences; as,</p>
<p>\
Right: Motor wagons are economical. Department stores of all large cities are acquiring them.</p>
<p>\
Sometimes the thought in the two principal clauses is closely connected. In that case they may be put into the same sentence, provided they are properly connected or separated. Use a comma plus a coÃ¶rdinate conjunction (as and, or, but) to connect them, or a semicolon (;) to separate them.</p>
<p>\
Be particularly careful of the conjunctive adverbs so, then, therefore, thus, also, still, otherwise, however, hence, consequently, moreover, nevertheless. When they are used to join the principal clauses of a compound sentence, a comma is not sufficient punctuation between the clauses. A semicolon or a comma and a coÃ¶rdinate conjunction must be used.</p>
<p>\
Wrong: He had been a good customer, so they were sorry to lose his trade.</p>
<p>\
Right: He had been a good customer; so they were sorry to lose his trade.</p>
<p>\
Right: He had been a good customer, and so they were sorry to lose his trade.</p>
<p>\
S. 2.â€”The first form of the sentence error (S 1) is made by using too much for one sentence. The second form (S 2) is made by using too little. It consists in writing a subordinate clause or a phrase as a sentence; as,</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Wrong: I told her I would attend to the matter at my earliest convenience. Probably on my way from work in the evening.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Wrong: His doctor advised him to go to Arizona. Which he decided to do.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>\
Exercise 61 Each sentence should express one complete thought. Some of the following are really two sentences (S 1), and some are only parts of sentences (S 2). Correct each, naming the mistake.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>

<p><strong>Exercise 63 â€”Parts of Speech</strong></p>
<p>There are eight different kinds of words called parts of speech, which are used to make sentences. They are as follows:</p>
<p>\
Noun: The horse is brown.
Pronoun: He is the best horse of all.
Verb: He galloped to town.
Adjective: The brown horse is my favorite.
Adverb: He runs swiftly.
Preposition: We shall ride to town.
Conjunction: The night is clear and cold.
Interjection: Oh! My horse stumbled.</p>
<p>\
Thus a noun names something. A word that stands for a noun is a pronoun. Sometimes a different part of speech is used like a noun, and for the time being it becomes a noun. The verb is a very important part of speech, since without it there can be no sentence. The verb makes an assertion, asks a question, or gives a command. Adjectives are words that belong to or describe nouns or pronouns. Adverbs go with or modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Prepositions and conjunctions connect. Prepositions join their objects to other words in the sentence; conjunctions join words, phrases, or clauses. An interjection, such as the exclamation oh, is used without having grammatical relation to any other word in the sentence. A preposition always takes an object, the preposition and its object making a phrase. Grouping this information, we have:</p>

<p>\
A word is not always the same part of speech. We may say, "Did you starch the clothes?" in which case starch is a verb. A grocer may say, "The starch in these packages is always clean." In this sentence starch is a noun. The part of speech depends entirely on the way the word is used.</p>
<p>\
In the following, name the part of speech of each word in italic. Judge by the way the word is used in the sentence.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The desks have green pads.</p>
<p>\</p></li>

<p>\</p></li>

<p>\</p></li>

<p>\</p></li>

<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Little drops of water make the mighty ocean.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>I can do little of the work until the typewriter is repaired.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Do not belittle your work.</p>
<p>\</p></li>

<p>| cold | sure | polite | courteous |
|----|----|----|----|
| smooth | exact | precise | easy |
| bitter | bad | extreme | nice |
| loud | general | honest | glad |</p>
<p>\
<strong>Exercise 67</strong>

<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>He is the best man in the office.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>John was leaving as I came in this evening.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>He did not have his coat on.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>It was hanging over his arm.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>He stood on the top step several minutes, wondering whether he should wear the coat.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The handle fell off as I took the cup off the shelf.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The aeroplane flies over the city.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>I am going over to the factory.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Write sentences using above, across, down, up, underneath both as adverbs and as prepositions.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Exercise 68â€”Prepositional Phrases</strong></p>
<p>Illustrations
Adjective: The opinions of some people must be taken with caution.</p>
<p>\
Adverb: We shall return within a year.</p>
<p>\
Noun: From New York to San Francisco is a long trip.</p>
<p>\
What part of speech is each of the italicized phrases below? Remember that an adjective modifies a noun; an adverb modifies a verb, an adjective, or an adverb.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The waves are rolling in, white with foam.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>A million dollars was invested in the business.</p>
<p>\</p></li>

<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>We shall stay here until spring.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>We came in sight of the king's palace.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>We drove to the factory today with the superintendent.</p>
<p>\</p></li>

</ol>
<p>\
<strong>Exercise 69</strong></p>

<p>\
<strong>Exercise 70</strong>
Name all the prepositional phrases in Exercise 179, explaining whether they are adjective or adverbial.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Exercise 71â€”The Clause</strong>
A subordinate clause, like a phrase, is a group of words used as a part of speech, the chief difference being that a clause must have a subject and a predicate. Clauses are introduced</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li>By relative pronouns:</li>
</ol>
<p>who, whose, whom, which, what, tha</p>
<p>t
2. By subordinate conjunctions:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/uWHX2AOp15Vcri9dCdTM3k3MYKp1-prb3ym7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Does the clause or the simple adverb give the more definite idea?</p>
<p>\n  <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/uWHX2AOp15Vcri9dCdTM3k3MYKp1-50c3yyt.png" alt="" /> \n Write three sentences illustrating adjective clauses, three illustrating adverbial clauses, and three illustrating noun clauses.</p>

Explain the use of each.</p>
<p>\n <strong>Exercise 73</strong></p>
<p>Write sentences using each of the following words to introduce a phrase, and to introduce a clause.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>after</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>before</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>for</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>since</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>until</p></li>
</ol>
<p>\
Remember that just as a preposition must be followed by an&nbsp;<em>object</em>&nbsp;to form a phrase, a conjunction must be followed by a&nbsp;<em>subject</em>&nbsp;to form a clause.</p>
<p>\n  <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/uWHX2AOp15Vcri9dCdTM3k3MYKp1-ajd3y9o.png" alt="Illustration" /></p>

</em></div><h2>Book VII: Chapter III. Of the Objects of Strategical Attack</h2><div class="paragraph">The overthrow of the enemy is the aim in war; destruction of the hostile military forces, the means both in attack and defence. By the destruction of the enemyâ€™s military force, the defensive is led on to the offensive, the offensive is led by it to the conquest of territory. Territory is, therefore, the object of the attack; but that need not be a whole country, it may be confined to a part, a province, a strip of country, a fortress. All these things may have a substantial value from their political importance, in treating for peace, whether they are retained or exchanged.</div><div class="paragraph">The object of the strategic attack is, therefore, conceivable in an infinite number of gradations, from the conquest of the whole country down to that of some insignificant place. As soon as this object is attained, and the attack ceases, the defensive commences. We may, therefore, represent to ourselves the strategic attack as a distinctly limited unit. But it is not so if we consider the matter practically, that is in accordance with actual phenomena. Practically the moments of the attack, that is, its views and measures, often glide just as imperceptibly into the defence as the plans of the defence into the offensive. It is seldom, or at all events not always, that a general lays down positively for himself what he will conquer, he leaves that dependent on the course of events. His attack often leads him further than he had intended; after rest more or less, he often gets renewed strength, without our being obliged to make out of this two quite different acts; at another time he is brought to a standstill sooner than he expected, without, however, giving up his intentions, and changing to a real defensive. We see, therefore, that if the successful defence may change imperceptibly into the offensive; so on the other hand an attack may, in like manner, change into a defence. These gradations must be kept in view, in order to avoid making a wrong application of what we have to say of the attack in general.</div><div class="Divider"><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i></div><div class="paragraph"><em>About HackerNoon Book Series: We bring you the most important technical, scientific, and insightful public domain books.</em></div><div class="paragraph"><em>This book is part of the public domain.

Stepping into the labyrinth of entrepreneurship, I have realized that the fast-paced digital age requires businesses to constantly innovate, adapt, and strive for efficiency. My journey as a startup entrepreneur for 8 years has made me appreciate the importance of Enterprise Business Applications (EBAs).</p>
<p>\
These comprehensive systems that integrate various business functions act as the backbone for businesses in the evolving digital landscape.</p>
<p>\
By reading this article, youâ€™ll not only know what an enterprise business application is and how to make it work for your business. Youâ€™ll also have the strategic thinking you need to lead your organization to digital resilience.</p>
<p>\
So, are you ready to improve your operational efficiency and productivity? Letâ€™s journey together into the remarkable universe of enterprise business applications!</p>
<h2 id="whatisanenterprisebusinessapplication">What Is an Enterprise Business Application?</h2>
<p>As an entrepreneur, the decision to create an EBA for my startup was strategic. The process involved analyzing the various channels of my business, defining the goals, and then meticulously designing the application to support our unique processes.</p>
<p>\
It was an interesting mix of making fundamental decisions about custom vs. off-the-shelf, on-prem vs. cloud storage, mobile access, and scalability. Ensuring compliance with regulatory and industry standards and data security, while maintaining a simple end-<a href="https://flatlogic.com/blog/7-reasons-why-ui-matters-in-web-development/">user interface</a>, felt like a juggling act, but was an important learning experience.</p>
<p>\
So, letâ€™s first take a look at what an enterprise business application is.<a href="https://flatlogic.com/">  <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ufHFIbIBOXgbkRWX4uMx6Y5qg1c2-2023-10-25T01:12:52.603Z-q5ga6jf4q3tcbdxwh1p20l5w" alt="Enterprise Business Apps in minutes. Generate Now!" /></a></p>
<p>Enterprise business applications (EBA) are designed to promote collaboration and coordination across the enterprise by unifying the computer systems that manage different aspects of an organizationâ€™s operations. This includes integrating critical business processes such as sales, accounting, finance, human resources, inventory, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>\
The ultimate enterprise system would track every key activity in the enterprise in real-time, using a single software architecture. In addition, the scope of enterprise software is expanding to connect the enterprise with suppliers, business partners, and customers.</p>
<h2 id="casesofenterprisebusinessapplications">Cases Of Enterprise Business Applications</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ufHFIbIBOXgbkRWX4uMx6Y5qg1c2-2023-10-25T01:12:52.609Z-gagrzwb5t5ym13nc28c7ofcf" alt="" /></p>
<p>As a startup entrepreneur researching enterprise applications, Iâ€™ve noticed that organizations that have integrated these applications into their operations have experienced impressive productivity gains and process improvements.</p>
<p>\
To help me, and perhaps you, better understand the concept of an enterprise application, letâ€™s take a look at some common examples:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)</li>
<li>Business Intelligence Systems</li>
<li>Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</li>
<li>Point-of-<a href="https://flatlogic.com/blog/happyeaster-flatlogic-gives-50-discount-on-all-templates/">Sale</a>&nbsp;(POS) software</li>
<li>Human Resource Systems (HR)</li>
<li>Accounting and billing systems</li>
<li>Supply chain management (SCM)</li>
</ul>
<p>\
Take accounting and billing systems like QuickBooks for instance; youâ€™re better equipped to handle cash flow and keep track of corporate financial transactions and projections. Imagine not having it; tracking revenue and expenses would be quite laborious.</p>
<p>\
Exploring Customer Relationship Management, letâ€™s take a look at HubSpot. It is a CRM application that helps to collect and manage information about potential customers. It helps improve customer relationships, fuels sales growth, and provides customer access to company data.</p>
<p>\
Point-of-Sale (POS) software.&nbsp;<a href="https://flatlogic.com/blog/ways-to-make-an-ecommerce-store-on-node-js-in-2021-guide-for-beginners/">Shopify</a>&nbsp;POS is an example. It logs customer transactions and informs businesses about sales and product inventory. Retailers and fashion outlets need such systems to manage products and purchases.</p>
<p>\
Supply Chain Management (SCM) software like SAP SCM assists companies in handling both internal operations and collaborations with third-party partners across the supply chain. This eliminates any bridges among manufacturers, distributors, and points of sale.</p>
<p>\
When trying to find a suitable solution, pay good attention to your specific business goals. Consider what aligns best with your operations.</p>
<h2 id="prosconsofenterprisebusinessapplications">Pros &amp; Cons Of Enterprise Business Applications</h2>
<h3 id="prosofenterprisebusinessapplication">Pros of Enterprise Business Application</h3>
<p>As my startup grew, I found that the benefits of EBA were many and varied. It centralized all of my business processes on one platform. This change increased visibility, accelerated decision-making, and improved efficiency.</p>
<p>\
Automating routine tasks allowed my team and I to focus more on strategic decision-making and innovation, while the scalability meant we didnâ€™t have to worry about outgrowing our system.</p>
<p>\
Most importantly, we were able to serve our customers more effortlessly, resulting in greater satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="consofenterprisebusinessapplications">Cons of Enterprise Business Applications</h3>
<p>But the journey wasnâ€™t without its challenges. The cost of implementing EBA was significant for a startup company like mine. It included licensing, implementation, training, and maintenance costs that at times felt overwhelming.</p>
<p>\
There were times when the complexity of the functionality and the professional training became an ordeal. We also experienced a few system outages that resulted in minor productivity losses.</p>
<h2 id="buildingyourenterprisebusinessapplication">Building Your Enterprise Business Application</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s talk about how these applications have changed my own business. I needed an efficient, auditable way to track inventory, sales, and deliveries for my retail business.</p>
<p>\
At first, I relied heavily on manual processes that were cumbersome, error-prone, and inefficient. That is when I discovered the magic of enterprise applications.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ufHFIbIBOXgbkRWX4uMx6Y5qg1c2-2023-10-25T01:12:52.611Z-keb56m2lcmlpbt862iuz35ni" alt="" /></p>
<p>Before embarking on the journey to create an enterprise business application that meets my organizationâ€™s needs, itâ€™s important to develop a strategy. This will serve as my guide to success. I need to take a hard look at all the software my company currently uses to see what works and where we can get more value out of it.</p>
<p>\
Iâ€™ll also need to consider how this new application will work with the software we want to keep. Itâ€™s also important to establish specific, measurable KPIs so that we can realistically measure our success.</p>
<p>\
The expertise of my team is also carefully evaluated â€“ while we may save costs by developing in-house, without the right skills we may not be able to meet our needs efficiently.</p>
<p>\
With a well-thought-out plan in place, Iâ€™d like to walk you through the personal path I would take to build an enterprise business application. This includes basic&nbsp;<a href="https://flatlogic.com/blog/6-phases-of-the-software-development-life-cycle/#-3">Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) stages</a>, such as:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first step is to think about your business goals. Determine what you are trying to accomplish with this application and identify the features needed to support those goals.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The second step is setting your financial boundaries before you dive in. Knowing how much you can invest allows my development team to focus on what matters and prioritize accordingly.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Next, write down what you need â€“ create a roadmap. This is where you write a detailed outline of your goals, expectations, and the core functions your new business application must fulfill.</p>
<p>\
Also is needed to list the software it must synchronize with and any development specifics, such as platforms or technologies youâ€™d like to use. Creating a wireframe can be daunting, but fortunately, your technical team can guide you through it.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The next step is to design the&nbsp;<a href="https://flatlogic.com/blog/react-admin-templates/">UI</a>/UX. A&nbsp;<a href="https://flatlogic.com/blog/7-trends-in-javascript-to-look-for-in-2020/">web</a>&nbsp;designer is a specialist who can bring your dreams to life, based on your technical requirements from the previous stage, the designer will create an appealing and user-friendly design.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Build and test your application. It is exciting to see your business application being built. During this phase, you need to be sure to get feedback from my team and incorporate their valuable insights.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>The last, but most important, is to deploy and maintain. Now itâ€™s time for the big debut! Install the application on your teamâ€™s devices and, if the application is for consumers, make sure the application is available in&nbsp;<a href="https://flatlogic.com/blog/difference-between-react-and-angular-a-comparison-guide-for-2021/">app</a>&nbsp;stores. Keep in mind, however, that reaching this milestone isnâ€™t the end of your journey. Youâ€™ll need to stay open to feedback, constantly tweak and fine-tune the application as needed, and address any glitches promptly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>\
Of course, integrating the companyâ€™s business applications wasnâ€™t a cakewalk. As with any technology implementation, there were bumps in the road, such as data migration, employee training, and resistance to change. But with a dedicated IT team, we overcame the obstacles.</p>
<p>\
Looking back, I can confidently say that the initial hurdles were minor compared to the resulting business growth and efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="keyfeaturesofenterprisebusinessapplications">Key Features of Enterprise Business Applications</h2>
<p>The features of an EBA that worked wonders for my startup were seamless process integration, customization, real-time data, and analytics. These features gave me a clear, data-rich view of my companyâ€™s performance, which helped me make quick, informed decisions. The key features of EBAs are:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To grow and shrink as needed, enterprise business applications must have robust scalability. It should integrate with other software systems such as CRM, ERP, and HR. Customization, which allows organizations to tailor the software to their specific needs, is another cornerstone feature.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>A user-friendly interface is essential for increasing user adoption and reducing training time.</p>
<p>Mobile compatibility to support the prevalent remote working and BYOD culture is also important. High performance is also required, as enterprise applications are designed to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Because of the sensitive nature of data in enterprise applications, security is paramount. This means encrypting data, authenticating users, controlling access, and keeping security up to date.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Enterprise applications give organizations the choice between remote accessibility and tighter data control and are generally adaptable to both cloud and on-premises deployments. To reduce the potential for human error and free up resources, they typically offer automated workflows. And importantly, these applications provide real-time reporting and analysis to help you make decisions and forecasts.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>For organizations that operate in multiple geographies, enterprise business applications should provide multilingual support. To help organizations meet regulatory requirements, these applications should also include compliance management capabilities. Data management capabilities are essential for securely storing, sharing, and protecting critical business data.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>One function that is often underestimated is technical support. Itâ€™s necessary to troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly. To give businesses the freedom to choose a plan that fits their budget and needs, many business applications offer flexible pricing. Collaboration tools that simplify tasks such as file sharing and&nbsp;<a href="https://flatlogic.com/blog/8-reasons-to-use-javascript-libraries-in-project-management-apps/">project management</a>&nbsp;are also built into business applications.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="whybusinessesneedenterprisebusinessapplications">Why Businesses Need Enterprise Business Applications</h2>
<p>Whether you are a business tycoon or a startup owner like me, the need for efficient EBA implementation is imperative. The integration of various business processes provides a holistic understanding of your business that is otherwise difficult to achieve. Such a view leads to improved efficiency, informed decisions, and increased profitability.</p>
<p>\
In hindsight, I only wish we had implemented our EBA sooner, as I can see how it is now driving our competitiveness and profitability in todayâ€™s dynamic marketplace.</p>
<h2 id="howtobuildenterprisebusinessapplicationflatlogicssolution">How to Build Enterprise Business Application: Flatlogicâ€™s Solution</h2>

With Flatlogic on your side, youâ€™ve got a guide through the turbulent world of modern EBA programming.</p>
<h2 id="summingup">Summing Up</h2>
<p>Rolling out our EBA was an exhilarating experience. We were faced with challenges such as integrating prior-used software, migrating data, employee training, and managing resistance to change, but this is to be expected with technology implementation.</p>
<p>\
However, I am proud to say that these minor roadblocks pale in significance to the growth and efficiency the EBA provided.</p>
<p>\
So, there you have it. The value of an EBA to my business, and hopefully to yours. I firmly believe that the most important outcome of all this was the massively improved functionality of my business and data-informed decision-making. Prepared to build your</p>
<p>entrepreneurial journey with EBAs?</p>

Dave didnâ€™t come home to dinner.

<h2 id="lovedaygrowsmysterious">LOVEDAY GROWS MYSTERIOUS</h2>
<p>Estelle&nbsp;was gone so long that I thought she must have stayed to the one oâ€™clock dinner; twelve or one oâ€™clock dinners were universal in Palmyra. But before we reached our apple dumpling dessert she came in, with a glow that was more than that caused by the frosty air.</p>
<p>\
Dave didnâ€™t come home to dinner. The distance from the shipyard was too short to be any hindrance, and Cyrus always came, as a matter of course, but Dave said that a workman could not make his toilet in the middle of the day. He said it without the least bitterness; from first to last there never was any bitterness about Dave. Sometimes I thought Cyrus would have a higher opinion of him if he would take his punishmentâ€”or&nbsp;his penanceâ€”less cheerfully. I suppose we should not have liked Dave to sit at the table in his workmanâ€™s clothes, not because he was a workman, but because he was Dave. I always thought, while I ate, of Dave with the cold luncheon which he carried. Cyrus had arranged a way for the workmen to heat their coffeeâ€”that was after Estelle insisted upon carrying something hot to Dave. But I think it was Dave himself who stopped her. While he was far from posing as a martyr he was determined to do the real thing, as a workman should.</p>
<p>\
â€œNo, I didnâ€™t stay to dinner,â€ Estelle said in answer to Octaviaâ€™s question. â€œThere was turnip in the soup; it smelled all over the house.â€ Estelle was fastidious to a degree, and so, indeed, was Dave, far more so than the rest of us. â€œBut I had some of Robâ€™s broth, which he wouldnâ€™t touch, and a bit of toast. I donâ€™t want any dinner.â€</p>
<p>\
She spoke absent-mindedly, and she didnâ€™t reply to grandma and Octavia who gently&nbsp;remonstrated, or to Loveday, who first scolded, and then immediately had a piece of yesterdayâ€™s plum-pudding warmed for her. Estelle was fond of plum-pudding and Loveday always saved a piece for her, as she had done from the time she was a child.</p>
<p>\
But when I went to her room, an hour later, the plum-pudding was untouched on the tray where Viola had set it, and Estelle was fiercely setting a patch upon the knee of Daveâ€™s blue overalls. Fiercely may be a trifle too strong an adjective, but I know of no other that so well describes the grim energy of her action. I think Daveâ€™s unaccustomed work must have been as fiercely done, for both pairs that he wore were already worn out at the knees.</p>
<p>\
â€œEstelle, if you had found out anythingâ€”anything in Daveâ€™s favor from Robâ€”of course you would tell me,â€ I said.</p>
<p>\
â€œI donâ€™t know but I should tell you, Bathsheba,â€ she said slowly. â€œBut there is nothing to tell. Rob is very elusive,&nbsp;you know; he is not in the least like his father.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œCertainly Uncle Horace is about as elusive as a sledge hammer,â€ said I.</p>
<p>\
â€œBut I had my suspicions confirmed. He knows all about it, and he had more to do with it than he will tell,â€ she declared positively.</p>
<p>\
â€œI donâ€™t see how he could have had anything to do with it,â€ I retorted, in my stupidly argumentative way, although I knew argument was useless, even if all argument had not been exhausted on that subject. â€œHe was ill in bed at the time, and if he hadnâ€™t been no one could ever suspect him of having anything to do with horse-races. He never could bear to see horses trained. The only time he and Dave ever quarreled was when Dave broke in the colts. He didnâ€™t send Dave to the races. Rob never was the least bit coarse. I didnâ€™t think Dave was, eitherâ€”â€”â€</p>
<p>\
â€œBut you lost all faith in him at the first&nbsp;trial!â€ interrupted Estelle, not reproachfully, but in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p>\
â€œDidâ€”did Rob say that he thought that there was any excuse for Dave?â€ I said. How could I say that he thought Dave didnâ€™t do it, when Dave had virtually owned that he did?</p>
<p>\
Estelle congealed at once. â€œI didnâ€™t ask him,â€ she answered and took such a great snip in the overalls that she was forced to cut out a larger patch. But as new light shone in her eyes, there was no doubt about it that her suspicions, whatever they were, had been confirmed.</p>
<p>\
But I, who did not, as she demanded, believe in Dave, was not accounted worthy to be told what she had discovered. I thought, myself, it was fancy. She admitted that there was nothing to tell and yet the look in her eyes told me that there was something from which she shut me out.</p>
<p>\
I left her to her patching, and went across the bridge to Uncle Horaceâ€™s myself. I had&nbsp;not thought of it until grandma said she wished she had known that Estelle was going over, because she wanted to send some calves-foot jelly to Rob. I said, at once, that I would go and carry it.</p>
<p>\
Rob would be no more elusive to me than to Estelle. I remembered now that she had never been one of his favorites. I had even fancied sometimes that he was a little jealous of her influence over Dave.</p>
<p>\
â€œLoveday will take the jelly out of the mould for you,â€ grandma had said. And I sought for Loveday, knowing that she was so dainty and particular about her jelly that she disliked to have any one touch it. But Loveday was not to be found, and Viola had retired to don the plaid dress that was her afternoon toilet, adorned with cherry ribbons for the beguiling of Leander Green, a persistent bachelor. So I emptied the mould myself, taking care that the jelly rose should not be shorn of a petal, and that it should be as daintily arranged as possible to tempt the&nbsp;invalidâ€™s appetite. And across the bridge I went, hearing the workmenâ€™s hammers from the shipyard on the way, with my heart sore for Dave, and determined that if I thought from his actions that Rob really knew anything about the matter he should not be elusive with me. I was not one of the clever ones of the family, and I knew it, but I had the persistency that always accompanied the Partridge nose.</p>
<p>\
I found Rob lying on a lounge in his own room. It was a chintz-covered lounge and against its gay colors his face looked woefully wan and wasted.</p>
<p>\
â€œRob, you ought to have come home before,â€ I exclaimed, too frank in my dismay at his changed looks. â€œPalmyra air and home nursing are the things to make you pick up!â€ I added hastily and as cheerfully as I could.</p>
<p>\
â€œI knew he didnâ€™t want me to comeâ€”father, you know. He thinks I havenâ€™t any pluck.â€ There was a deep, anxious line between&nbsp;the boyâ€™s delicately-penciled brows. â€œDave, now, ought to have been his son.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œDave!â€ I echoed wonderingly. â€œHe canâ€™t bear Dave!â€</p>
<p>\
â€œThatâ€™s because he doesnâ€™t know him. I do.â€ Rob had a kind of triumphant air as of a great discoverer. â€œWhatever fathers and mothers and teachers may think, it takes one fellow to know another. When it comes to pluck, now, Dave is all there. Heâ€™s simply great!â€</p>
<p>\
â€œBut pluck isnâ€™t everything,â€ I said seriously, â€œthat is what you boys call pluck. To be good is always the very hardest and bravest thing.â€</p>
<p>\
I expected that my trite copy-book sentiment would elicit scorn. One had to learn the art of putting things to our boys. But instead of being scornful Rob became reflective.</p>
<p>\
â€œPerhaps thatâ€™s true. I rather think it is,â€ he said. â€œBut sometimes it isnâ€™t so easy for a fellow to say what is goodness. And things put you into such a fix that you canâ€™t get outâ€”unless&nbsp;you have brains and pluck, like Dave.â€</p>
<p>\
This was somewhat enigmatical; if it signified anything it was that there had been some boyish â€œscrapeâ€ out of which Dave had extricated one or both of them. Rob certainly seemed to have no sense whatever of Daveâ€™s moral lapse.</p>
<p>\
â€œNothingâ€”nothing could possibly place any one in such a position that it would be necessary for such wrong-doing as Daveâ€™s,â€ I said severely. â€œAlthough Dave is my brother, and I am quite as fond of him as if he were my own brother, yet I canâ€™t help saying, Rob, that I think it is very dangerous for you to make a hero of him.â€</p>
<p>\
He started up from the couch, his face flushed and his blue eyes blazing. He looked like the portrait of his beautiful young mother who had died when he was a baby. There was something fine and lofty in his expression; it was almost the look of an accusing angel.</p>
<p>\
â€œYouâ€”you donâ€™tâ€”â€”â€ he began and faltered, it was, or I fancied that it was, as Uncle Horaceâ€™s heavy steps sounded in the room below.</p>
<p>\
â€œGirls are such fools!â€ he growled, as he fell back upon his pillows. â€œAs muchâ€”as much as fifty of you wouldnâ€™t be worth Daveâ€™s little finger!â€ The footstep had ceased to reach our ears now and his voice arose high-keyed and shrill.</p>
<p>I bent over him, obeying a sudden </p>
<p>impulse.</p>
<p>\
â€œRob, if you know that Dave didnâ€™t go to the races andâ€”and lose his money, if there was any strange mistake, of course it would be your duty to tellâ€”you would want to tell to clear Dave at any cost to yourself.â€</p>
<p>\
He started up again and scowled at me angrily.</p>
<p>\
â€œWhat cost could it be to me? I am not much of a fellow to go to races, am I?â€”a fellow who has no more strength than a girl because every once in a while he is choked to death for days and days and nights and&nbsp;nights, and is a disgrace and a disappointment to his father!â€</p>
<p>\
â€œOh, not a disgrace, Rob, not a disgrace!â€ I interrupted. â€œI think it would kill Uncle Horace if you were that. I hope you donâ€™t think that illness like yours could ever be a disgrace!â€</p>
<p>\
â€œKill him? kill father? I guess it would make him kill me, more likely!â€ he said, with a queer, grim, little chuckle. â€œHe thinks itâ€™s a disgrace to be weak and girly. It makes a fellow like that, Bathsheba, to be the way Iâ€™ve been!â€ He spoke with sudden earnestness, his voice growing husky. â€œNo one understands all about it but Dave; itâ€™s queer when heâ€™s so strong and plucky himself. Usually a plucky fellow thinks you ought to be so, too. He thinks itâ€™s just as easy! But Dave can put himself in another fellowâ€™s place; and weâ€™ve been together such a lot. He liked to go with me just as well as with the boys that were stronger and different. He said so, anyway.â€ The boy suddenly&nbsp;raised himself again and looked up wistfully into my face. â€œYou donâ€™t think he was making believe because he pitied me, do you, Bathsheba? Iâ€™ve been thinking of a good many things since Iâ€™ve been sick this time.â€</p>
<p>\
He looked so pitiful, his angular figure quite devoid of boyish grace, with narrow, stooping shoulders and sunken chest and his eyes so big and dark with the great hollows around them, that tears suddenly filled my eyes.</p>
<p>\
â€œI donâ€™t think Dave ever made believe in his life,â€ I said heartily. â€œAt least he isnâ€™t deceitful.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œBut you pity me,â€ he said, looking suspiciously at my tears. â€œIâ€™ve been thinking it would be better if I should die. Thatâ€™s the way it would turn out in a story-book, and then everything would be all right.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œThe way what would turn out? What would be all right?â€ I demanded sharply.</p>
<p>\
â€œWhyâ€”whyâ€”Dave wouldnâ€™t have to&nbsp;bother with me, and father would never be ashamed of me any more.â€</p>
<p>\
Of course I scolded him, calling him weak and foolish, and trying to rouse him to the courage and the trust in Godâ€™s Providence that alone could help him. I pitied him so that I almost forgot Dave and that my errand had been to try to find evidence that he was innocentâ€”or at least less guilty than he seemed. I could not feel that I had found anything at all satisfactory in that line. It did seem likely that Rob knew more about the matter than he meant to tell, but it was scarcely possible that it was anything that could clear Dave. When a fellowâ€™s inheritance was such a puny body as his, and an incurable disease, it was better that he should die, persisted Rob. And I knew it was no time for preaching, but I remembered the strong helpful text that was engraved upon the tiles of the Deemsterâ€™s mantel:</p>
<p>\
â€œGodâ€™s Providence is Mine Inheritance.â€</p>
<p>\
And I at once set out for home determined to get Estelle to print it, in beautiful old English script, and paint a flower border and then I would hang it in his room. Rob loved pretty things, like a girl. I knew Estelle would be a little scornful at my idea of helping Rob with a motto, I who was the practical one; but a small thing will sometimes have a strong effect upon a morbid mind.</p>
<p>\
That was the idea that was uppermost in my mind as I hurried out of the yard, by the long stables, to make a short cut to the river bank and cross on the ice, when I ran into Loveday coming out of the old, unused carriage-house. Now there was nothing astonishing in that, for Marcella, Uncle Horaceâ€™s housekeeper, was Lovedayâ€™s second-cousin and they often visited each other, but the astonishing thing was that Loveday should start guiltily at sight of me, flush scarlet over to the crisp black waves of her hair and thrust something that she held in her hand&nbsp;hastily under her shawlâ€”Loveday, whose greatest horror was of â€œunder-handednessâ€ and who boasted that she never had had a secret in her life.</p>
<p>\
I glanced back, involuntarily, at the old carriage-house. I remembered suddenly that Hiram Nuteâ€™s photograph wagon was stored there for the winter. A traveling photograph gallery had been one of Hiramâ€™s â€œcombernationsâ€ of the last summer. It had suited his taste admirably.</p>
<p>\
â€œThere wasnâ€™t nowhere that you saw so much human nater, without it was top of a tin-peddlerâ€™s wagon, as you did a takinâ€™ folksâ€™ photographs,â€ he said.</p>
<p>\
Loveday withdrew her objection that it was â€œkind of flighty,â€ in view of its paying qualities, and Hiram gave it up reluctantly and late, for the winter. I remembered hearing that Uncle Horace had given him the use of the old building as a storage house. I also remembered having seen Hiram running the wagon in there just before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>\
It seemed quite natural that Loveday should have gone into it, to see that all was safe, Hiram having gone on one of his essence-peddling tours into another State. But whyâ€”why should Loveday look guilty about it? She stammered that she was going in a minute to see Marcella; she hadnâ€™t time to be gallivantinâ€™ â€™round, but seeinâ€™ there was sickness in the house she expected â€™twas folksâ€™ duty to come and inquire. It struck me that this was probably the first time in her life that Loveday had prevaricated. The stress of the moment turned her pale and afterwards she looked angryâ€”either at herself or me. She had had some errand to Hiramâ€™s photograph wagon and it was a secret one; so much was easy to gather from Lovedayâ€™s manner. But when even Loveday became mysterious I felt that life was too involved a matter for my simple brains.</p>
<p>\
I left her with relief, and slid out upon the river; the strong west wind blew me toward the shipyard, and I stopped to see Dave. I&nbsp;had not been there since he had gone to work, partly because it was not an attractive place in the winter, partly because I shrank from seeing him at work there.</p>
<p>\
Dave evidently did not shrink from being seen. When I came near he was swinging himself down from the stocks of the ship whose inside work he was helping to finish. At first I could not discover to whom he was talking, but I saw that he looked like a young Viking with his fine, athletic shape and his blond coloring, even in his blue overalls, that pair had one of Estelleâ€™s patches upon the knee, and his rough working jacket.</p>
<p>\
Alice Yorke and her father had been skating; they were such lovers of the sport that they were not deterred, like the rest of us, by the roughness of the ice which had frozen in little ridges after a thaw. The doctor had broken one of his skates and had stopped at the shipyard to repair it. It was to them that Dave was talking, when I came up, with&nbsp;as graceful and nonchalant an air as if he were in the most correct of evening dress at a reception. He had a hammer in his hand and he unloaded his overallsâ€™ pockets of nails and screws to find something with which to mend Dr. Yorkeâ€™s skate.</p>
<p>\
If it had been one of the Palmyra girls, with whom he had been acquainted from childhood, I should not have thought it strange; but Alice Yorke had come from the city, and there was about her an air of elegance and high-breeding that seemed to set her worlds apart from a workman in overalls. But she evidently thought no more about that little matter than did Dave, for they were having a most merry and sociable time.</p>
<p>\
The skate mending took a long time; none of the party seemed in a hurry. Daveâ€™s capacious overallsâ€™ pockets failed to yield a piece of string that was needed and I went into the little counting-house in search of it. I had seen a shadow across the window that I knew&nbsp;was Cyrusâ€™ tall angular form, and I wondered why he did not come out and join the party. We fancied, although it was an astonishing thing to fancy of Cyrus, that he went wherever he was likely to meet Alice Yorke. He groped near-sightedly for the string in a drawer of his desk. He did not say a word and his lips were tightly compressed.</p>
<p>\
My feelings were queerly divided. I was conscious that I had been having a pride in Daveâ€™s manliness that had made me almost forget his moral failings. I read in Cyrusâ€™ dark face that he was both ashamed of Dave and a little jealous of him; we all think we can read the faces of our own, and are often as blind as moles.</p>
<p>\
No, Cyrus would not come out; he was busy. But I knew that he continued to pace the office floor after I had gone, as he had done before I came.</p>
<p>\
Alice Yorke and Dave were still keeping up their gay trifling, but Alice turned her head eagerly toward the counting-house door&nbsp;as it closed upon me, and she looked a little disappointedâ€”at least a little crest-fallen, when she saw that I was alone. Perhaps she was not content, like the Palmyra girls, with one string to her bow, I thought a little bitterly, for I didnâ€™t want either of my boys played with, mouse-fashion, by a mischief of a girl.</p>
<p>\
â€œGood gracious, you donâ€™t think you have to take care of Cyrus, do you?â€ Octavia had said to me scornfully.</p>
<p>\
But I still thought that Cyrus might have his weaknesses, like any one else. It seemed to me that when one was enduring a long strain of painful duty and self-sacrifice, it might be just the time when a little consoling sweetness would easily reach his heart.</p>
<p>\
Dave walked home with me. I had waited for him after Alice and her father had gone skating off over the rough surface of the river. His working hours were soon over in these short winter days.</p>
<p>\
â€œThere are so few men now, Dave,â€ I said&nbsp;wonderingly, as I watched the dark shapes that plodded off in the wintry dusk.</p>
<p>\
â€œAnother cut-down,â€ Dave answered shortly.</p>
<p>\
â€œBut it never was done before in the winter; grandpa wouldnâ€™t have allowed it!â€ I cried.</p>
<p>\
â€œCanâ€™t be helped,â€ said Dave concisely. â€œSee here, donâ€™t you talk to Cyrus about it, nor to any one so that heâ€™ll hear of it, but thereâ€™s been a heavy loss. That brig that went down in the great storm off Seguin was nearly all owned here. It was about all we had left, any of us. And through some loose screw in the underwriters there wonâ€™t be a cent of insurance. Havenâ€™t you noticed how glum Cyrus has been looking for a few days?â€</p>
<p>\
â€œI noticed that he was looking glum when I went into the office for the string,â€ I said. And Dave gave me a quick, quizzical glance.</p>
<p>\
Then, after a moment, he whistled sharply. â€œW-h-e-w! what dunces girls are!â€ he said.</p>
<p>\
But this was a remark that had somewhat lost its force from long use. As I have said before we are a candid family.</p>
<p>\
â€œPoor old Cyrus has a lot on his hands,â€ he continued seriously. â€œI donâ€™t think he has much of a head for business, and, if he had, I doubt whether he could keep things from going all wrong as times are now. He ought to have been a minister as he planned.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œDave, havenâ€™t you a head for business? Couldnâ€™t you take some of the responsibility?â€ I said eagerly. In the first moment of dismay I didnâ€™t think of the poverty that menanced us but only of the family honor, which seemed to me to be centred in the shipbuilding business.</p>
<p>\
â€œIf I had a head for business I am hardly in a position, just now, to offer my services as a responsible head of the firm!â€ said Dave dryly. And he left me to go to his own room, humming a light air that Alice Yorke sang.</p>
<p>\
The sense of misfortune deepened upon me&nbsp;suddenly. I heard the wolf at the door and felt as if his gaunt length were slinking up the stairs behind me, as I went to my room.</p>
<p>\
I sat down upon the edge of my bed with coat and hat still on and my practical mind slipped away from the mystery of Daveâ€™s wickedness and from Robâ€™s pitiful condition, and even from the family honor as involved in the shipbuilding business, to the possibility of adding gilt-edged butter to the already famous sage cheese and preserves from Groundnut Hill Farm.</p>
<p>\
I fear that my mind is scarcely large enough to contain more than one idea at a time and that fact accounts for my being rather stupid when Loveday came into my room, in the small hours of that night, with a bee in her bonnetâ€”or nightcap, rather, to be exact.</p>
<p>\
She had a large photograph in her hand; I recognized it at once as the object that she had hastily hidden under her shawl as she&nbsp;came out of Hiram Nuteâ€™s photograph wagon. She held her candle between the picture and my sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>\
â€œWhat does it â€™pear to you to be?â€ she demanded.</p>
<p>\
â€œA horse,â€ I said drowsily. It was a very poor photograph. It had been taken when Hiram first started out with his new â€œcombernation,â€ and it was blurred and badly finished. Beneath the photograph was printed â€œPrince Charley, Alf Reederâ€™s Great Racer.â€</p>
<p>\
Had Loveday become suddenly insane, that she should arise from her bed in the dead of the night to show me with trembling eagerness, this most uninteresting photograph?</p>
<p>\
â€œDoes it â€™pear to you to be any horse you ever saw?â€ demanded Loveday breathlessly.</p>
<p>\
I raised myself upon my elbow and looked at her in blinking bewilderment. I had heard that it was the proper thing to humor insane people.</p>
<p>\
â€œIâ€™ve seen so few race-horses, and I donâ€™t notice them much,â€ I stammered. â€œItâ€”it looks like a very fine horse.â€</p>
<p>\
â€œOh it does, does it? Thatâ€™s the way it â€™pears to you then.â€ Loveday heaved a long sigh. â€œNow it looks to me like one of them poor old creturs that are patched up and curry-combed and have plenty of oats give â€™em, and have the whip cracked over â€™em, and another horse set to runninâ€™ by â€™em to see if they canâ€™t get up a little spurt oâ€™ life, with their last breath, just to put money into somebodyâ€™s pocket. I used to see such things up to the Newmarket mile-ground when I was a girl. But there! Iâ€™m an old idiot, awakinâ€™ you up like this in the middle of the night. An idee ketched a holt of me, and when an idee ketches a holt of me between midnight and sun-up I canâ€™t get rid of it without I tell somebody. I was kind of glad I woke up, too, for the lantern was hung out acrost the river.â€</p>
<p>\
I sprang up. The lantern was the signal&nbsp;hung out at Uncle Horaceâ€™s when Rob was very ill and wanted Dave.</p>
<p>\
â€œYou waked him? Heâ€™s gone over?â€ I gasped.</p>
<p>\
â€œLa, yes; I watched him clear acrost the river in the moonlight, half an hour ago,â€ said Loveday. â€œI expect nothinâ€™ but what that boy is real sick, but it never took that old horse out of my mind. Beats all what an old idiot I be when an idee ketches a holt of me between midnight and sun-up!â€</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Your system is now installed! Pat yourself on the back for a job well done! Now itâ€™s time to start using the system. In this chapter, we introduce you to the Debian command line, some security principles, and how to exit the system. In later chapters, weâ€™ll go into more detail on these topics and introduce you to the Debian graphical interface, X11.

4.1 First Steps

After you quit dselect, youâ€™ll be presented with the login: prompt. You can now log in using the personal login and password you selected; your system is now ready to use. Letâ€™s examine what it means to log in and how this process works.

To use Debian, you must identify yourself to the system. This is so it knows who you are, what you have permission to do, and what your preferences are.

To this end, you have aÂ usernameÂ orÂ login. If you installed Debian yourself, you should have been asked to give such a name during installation. If you are logging on to a system administered by someone else, youâ€™ll have to ask him for an account on the system and a corresponding username.

You also have a password, so no one else can pretend to be you. If you donâ€™t have a password, anyone can log on to your computer from the Internet and do bad things. If youâ€™re worried about security, you should have a password.

Many people prefer to trust others not to do anything malicious with their account; hopefully your work environment doesnâ€™t encourage paranoia. This is a perfectly reasonable attitude; it depends on your personal priorities and your environment. Obviously a home system does not need to be as secure as a military installation. Debian allows you to be as secure or as insecure as you like.

When you start Debian, youâ€™ll see aÂ prompt:Â a request from the computer for some information. In this case, the prompt is login:.

You should type your username and, when requested, your password. The password does not appear on the screen as you type it. Press Enter after both the username and the password. If you type your username or password incorrectly, youâ€™ll have to start over.

If you do it correctly, youâ€™ll see a brief message and then a $ prompt. The $ is printed by a special program called theÂ shellÂ and is thus called aÂ shell prompt. This is where you give commands to the system.

Try entering the command whoami now. There is aÂ cursorÂ to the right of the shell prompt. Your cursor is a small underscore or rectangle that indicates where youâ€™re typing; it should move as you type. Always press Enter when youâ€™re done typing a shell command.

whoami tells your username. Youâ€™ll then get a new shell prompt.

For the rest of the book, when we say to enter a command, you should type it at the shell prompt and press the Enter key.

When youâ€™re done working, you may want to log out of the system. To exit the shell, enter the exit command. Keep in mind that if you remain logged in, someone could come along and use your account. Hopefully you can trust those in your office or home not to do this; but if you do not trust your environment, you should be certain to log out when you leave.]]></description>

Debian allows you to be as secure or as insecure as you like.</p>
<p>\
When you start Debian, youâ€™ll see a&nbsp;<em>prompt:</em>&nbsp;a request from the computer for some information. In this case, the prompt is login:.</p>
<p>\
You should type your username and, when requested, your password. The password does not appear on the screen as you type it. Press Enter after both the username and the password. If you type your username or password incorrectly, youâ€™ll have to start over.</p>

<h3 id="42commandhistoryandeditingthecommandline">4.2 Command History and Editing the Command Line</h3>
<p>Whatever you type after the shell prompt and before pressing Enter is called a&nbsp;<em>command line</em>. Itâ€™s a line of text that commands the computer to do something. The Debian default shell offers several features to make entering command lines easy.</p>
<p>\
You can scroll up to previous commands to run them again, or you can modify them slightly and&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;run them again. Try this: Enter any command, such as whoami; then press the Up Arrow key. The whoami command will reappear at the prompt. You can then press Enter to run whoami a second time.</p>
<p>\
If youâ€™ve entered several commands, you can keep pressing the Up Arrow key to go back through them. This feature is handy if youâ€™re doing the same thing several times, or if you type a command incorrectly and want to go back to fix it. You can press the Down Arrow key to move in the other direction, toward your more recent commands. If there are no more commands to move to, the computer will beep.</p>
<p>\
You can also move around on the command line to make changes. The easiest way is with the Left and Right Arrow keys. Try typing whoasmi instead of whoami, and then use the Left Arrow key to move back to the s. You can erase the s with the Backspace or Delete keys.</p>
<p>\
There are more advanced features as well (no need to memorize them all now, though). Try pressing Ctrl-a. This moves you to the beginning of the line. Ctrl-k (the k stands for â€œkillâ€) deletes all characters until the end of the line; try it from the middle of the command line. Using Ctrl-a followed by Ctrl-k, you can delete the entire command line. Ctrl-y pastes the last thing you killed, reinserting it at the current cursor position (y stands for â€œyank,â€ as in â€œyank it backâ€). Ctrl-e will move the cursor to the end of the command line.</p>
<p>\
Go ahead and play around with command-line editing to get a feel for it. Experiment.</p>
<h3 id="43workingasroot">4.3 Working as Root</h3>
<p>Because Debian is a multiuser system, itâ€™s designed to keep any one user or program from breaking the entire system. The kernel will not allow normal users to change important system files. This means that things stay the way theyâ€™re supposed to, safe from accidents, viruses, and even malicious pranks. Unlike other operating systems, Debian is safe from these threats. You wonâ€™t need an anti-virus program.</p>
<p>\
However, sometimes you need to change important system files; for example, you might want to install new software or configure your network connection. To do so, you have to have greater powers than a normal user; you must become the&nbsp;<em>root user</em>&nbsp;(also called the&nbsp;<em>superuser</em>).</p>
<p>\
To become root, just log on with the username root and the root password; this was set during installation, as described in section 3.15 on page [*].</p>
<p>\
At many sites, only the system administrator has the root password, and only the system administrator can do the things that one must be root to do. If youâ€™re using your own personal computer,&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;are the system administrator, of course. If you donâ€™t have root privileges, you will have to rely on your system administrator to perform any tasks that require root privileges.</p>
<p>\
Sometimes youâ€™ll have the root password even on a shared corporate or educational server, because the system administrator trusts you to use it properly. In that case, youâ€™ll be able to help administer the system and customize it for your needs. But you should be sure to use the password responsibly, respecting other users at all times.</p>
<p>\
If you have the password, try logging on as root now. Enter the whoami command to verify your identity. Then&nbsp;<em>log out immediately</em>. When youâ€™re root, the kernel will not protect you from yourself, because root has permission to do anything at all to the system. Donâ€™t experiment while youâ€™re root. In fact, donâ€™t do anything as root unless absolutely necessary. This isnâ€™t a matter of security, but rather of stability. Your system will run much better if it can keep you from making mistakes.</p>
<p>\
You may find the su command more convenient than logging in as root. su allows you to assume the identity of another user, usually root unless you specify someone else. (You can remember that su stands for Super User, though some say it stands for Set UserID.)</p>
<p>\
Hereâ€™s something to try. Log on as yourselfâ€”that is, not as root. Then your session will look something like the one in Figure 4.1.</p>
<p>\
 ![Figure 4.1: Sample session with su</p>
<p>](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/vSShvCAio4bqP19bBfmp6FnYQFk1-3u93ygw.jpeg)</p>
<p>When youâ€™re doing system administration tasks, you should do as much as possible as yourself. Then use su, do the part that requires root privileges, and use the exit command to turn off privileges so you can no longer harm anything.</p>
<p>\
You can use su to assume the identity of any user on the system, not just root. To do this, type su&nbsp;<em>user</em>&nbsp;where&nbsp;<em>user</em>&nbsp;is the user you want to become. Youâ€™ll have to know the userâ€™s password, of course, unless youâ€™re root at the time or the user has no password.</p>
<h3 id="44virtualconsoles">4.4 Virtual Consoles</h3>
<p>The Linux kernel supports&nbsp;<em>virtual consoles</em>. These provide a way of making your single screen and keyboard seem like multiple terminals that are connected to the same system. Thankfully, using virtual consoles is one of the simplest things about Debian: There are â€œhot keysâ€ for switching among the consoles quickly. To try it, log in to your system and press Alt-F2 (simultaneously press the left Alt key, and F2, that is, function key number 2).</p>
<p>\
You should find yourself at another login prompt. Donâ€™t panic: You are now on virtual console (VC) number 2! Log in here and do some thingsâ€”more whoami commands or whateverâ€”to confirm that this is a real login shell. Now you can return to virtual console number 1 by pressing Alt-F1. Or you can move on to a&nbsp;<em>third</em>&nbsp;virtual console, in the obvious way (Alt-F3).</p>
<p>\
Debian comes with six virtual consoles enabled by default, which you access with the Alt key and function keys F1 through F6. (Technically, there are more virtual consoles enabled, but only six of them allow you to log in. The others are used for the X Window system or other special purposes.)</p>
<p>If youâ€™re using the X Window system, it will generally start up on the first unused virtual consoleâ€”probably VC 7. Also, to switch from the X virtual console to one of the first six, youâ€™ll have to add Ctrl to the key sequence. So thatâ€™s Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get to VC 1. But you can go from a text VC to the X virtual console using only Alt. If you never leave X, you wonâ€™t have to worry about this; X automatically switches you to its virtual console when it starts up.</p>
<p>\
Once you get used to them, virtual consoles will probably become an indispensable tool for getting many things done at once. (The X Window system serves much the same purpose, providing multiple windows rather than multiple consoles.) You can run a different program on each VC or log on as root on one VC and as yourself on another. Or everyone in the family can use his or her own VC; this is especially handy if you use X, in which case you can run several X sessions at once on different virtual consoles.</p>
<h3 id="45shuttingdown">4.5 Shutting Down</h3>
<p><em>Do not just turn off the computer! You risk losing valuable data!</em></p>
<p>\
If you are the only user of your computer, you might want to turn the computer off when youâ€™re done with it.</p>
<p>\
To avoid possibly weakening some hardware components, only turn off the computer when youâ€™re done for the day. Power up and power down are the two greatest contributors to wear and tear on computer components. Turning the computer on and off once a day is probably the best compromise between your electric bill and your computerâ€™s lifespan.</p>
<p>\
Itâ€™s a bad thing to just press the power switch when youâ€™re done using the computer. It is also bad to reboot the machine (with the Reset button) without first taking proper precautions. The Linux kernel, in order to improve performance, has a disk cache. This means it temporarily stores information meant for permanent storage in RAM. Because memory is thousands of times faster than a disk, this makes many file operations move more quickly. Periodically, the information Linux has in memory is actually written to the disk. This is called&nbsp;<em>syncing</em>. In order to turn off or reboot the computer safely, youâ€™ll have to tell the computer to clear everything out of memory and put it in permanent storage.</p>
<p>\
To reboot, just type reboot or press Ctrl-Alt-Del (thatâ€™s Ctrl, Alt, and Delete).</p>
<p>\
To shut down, youâ€™ll have to log in as root. As root, just type the command shutdown -h now. The sytem will go through the entire shutdown procedure, including the sync command, which clears the disk cache as described above. When you see System halted, itâ€™s safe to turn off the computer. If you have Advanced Power Management (APM) support in your kernel and BIOS, the computer might shut itself off and save you the trouble. APM is common in laptops and is also found in certain desktop mainboards.</p>
