            <title><![CDATA[Following several rocky years, the automotive industry is getting its innovation groove back]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago, the automotive industry appeared poised for frenetic growth, with global carmakers snapping up autonomous driving startups for billions of dollars and making rosy promises to go fully electric. Then the COVID-19 pandemic stalled the roseate advance toward a greener, more Jetsons-esque streetscape.</p>



<p>During the resulting fallout, many companies working on battery-electric or self-driving technology, including Ford&#x2019;s Argo AI and General Motors&#x2019; Cruise subsidiaries, folded or suspended operations. But now, having adjusted to the supply shortages and other pandemic-related problems, the automotive industry is evolving at a more measured clip.</p>



<p>Still, the industry&#x2019;s evolution hinges upon challenges such as ongoing materials constraints, piecemeal legislation governing driving technology, and the lack of an established domestic battery supply chain. Even the outfits that survived recent rocky years continue to face setbacks: In February alone, California regulators stymied the planned expansion for Alphabet&#x2019;s Waymo; Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility laid off 13% of its workforce; and manufacturers continue to push back the goalposts set in rosier days.</p>



<p>But the theme du jour is that businesses are beginning to get their groove back, evidenced by the emergence of a variety of promising innovators, from AI-powered chatbot makers to lithium-ion battery recyclers. And it&#x2019;s not just newer businesses that are preparing for an electrified industry. Bridgestone, founded 93 years ago, debuted new rubber technology to shoulder the demands of heavy, high-torque EVs, which typically wear through a set of tires 30% to 40% faster than their gasoline-powered counterparts.</p>



<p>Many of the latest advances in autonomous driving are enabled by Luminar Technologies&#x2019; scalable lidar (light detection and ranging) equipment. In 2023, the Orlando, Florida-based company opened a 118,000-square-foot highly automated, high-volume manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico, to turbocharge its production capacity. Luminar also unveiled its long-range Iris+ sensor that helps cars see obstacles nearly 1,000 feet away.</p>



<p>Last year, Luminar customer Mercedes-Benz debuted its Drive Pilot technology, the first conditionally automated driving system for the U.S. market. The pair have also announced a partnership to equip the official safety car of the FIA Formula One, a crucial test bed for future consumer technology, with Luminar&#x2019;s lidar.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a handful of high-profile robotaxi mishaps, such as a driverless Cruise&#x2019;s dragging of a San Francisco pedestrian in October 2023, have slowed the development of autonomous driving. The collisions mark &#x201C;a failure less about the mechanics of driving and more about the&#xA0;vehicle&#x2019;s lack of situational awareness about&#xA0;where it was and what it was doing, something that humans do inherently,&#x201D; says Jason Torchinsky, author of 2019&#x2019;s Robot, Take the Wheel: The Road to Autonomous Cars and the Lost Art of Driving.</p>



<p>&#x201C;This is the wising-up period needed so that more reasonable goals can be set,&#x201D; Torchinsky says. &#x201C;If the pipe dream of full autonomy is set aside in favor of self-driving limited to specific locations, with some infrastructural help and agreed-upon global standards and protocols, we could have most of what we really want, which is being able to sleep on long, boring trips or in traffic.&#x201D;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What you can learn about Elon Musk from the movie he helped produce almost 20 years ago]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&#x201C;Few people on this planet know what it is to be truly despised,&#x201D; says Nick Naylor, the tobacco lobbyist at the center of 2005&#x2019;s Thank You for Smoking. Nearly 20 years after the film&#x2019;s release, Elon Musk, who many don&#x2019;t realize was one of its executive producers, has come to know the feeling well.</p>



<p>&#x201C;I have no problem being hated. Hate away,&#x201D; Musk told Andrew Ross Sorkin during last November&#x2019;s DealBook Summit. His remarks came as advertisers were fleeing the Musk-owned social media platform, X, following his endorsement of an antisemitic post claiming Jewish groups have long pushed &#x201C;hatred against whites.&#x201D; Until embarrassingly recent days some still considered Musk&#x2019;s political views elusive. That is no longer the case. He now openly feasts on a media diet of far-right bloggers and acts as customer support on X for the controversial @LibsofTikTok account. But while Musk once managed to fly under the radar as a mostly apolitical tech tycoon, the worldview of Thank You for Smoking seems to have a lot in common with the Tesla founder&#x2019;s personal POV today.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Winning an Oscar now just means you won the woke contest</p>&#x2014; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1766964360830652798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Shortly after eBay acquired PayPal in late 2002 for $1.5 billion, the company&#x2019;s then-COO David Sacks sought to use some of that windfall to break into the film business. He came across the screenplay for Thank You for Smoking, based on a novel by chief speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, Christopher Buckley. It&#x2019;s the story of a tobacco lobbyist, eventually played by Aaron Eckhart, working to get cigarettes into cinemas as stealth product placement, while fending off attacks from the media and the U.S. government. Sacks was smitten.</p>



<p>&#x201C;In any other movie the main character, this spin doctor, would be the villain,&#x201D; he told Forbes in 2006, &#x201C;but in this movie he is defending our freedom, defending our devices against priggishness.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Along with four others from the so-called PayPal Mafia&#x2014;Musk, Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, and Mark Woolway&#x2014;Sacks produced the film. He was the only one of the group to take a creatively hands-on role. Although Musk&#x2019;s involvement appears limited to a financial stake, a brief cameo, and a more utilitarian cameo from his private jet, the film seems right up the alley of his 2024 incarnation. It&#x2019;s not because Musk is a fan of smoking (he isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;though he did infamously smoke a joint on Joe Rogan&#x2019;s podcast), or even that he can identify with someone having an adversarial relationship with a Democratic senator from Vermont, like the one William H. Macy plays in the film. No, it&#x2019;s that the entire cynical-bordering-on-nihilistic outlook of Thank You for Smoking plays like something Musk would react to right now with a string of ROFL emojis.</p>



<h2>Debate me, you coward</h2>



<p>The lobbyist character Nick Naylor is introduced in the film on the set of a talk show, alongside a Health and Human Services flak and a 15-year old smoker diagnosed with cancer. During this appearance, our hero manages to turn the tables on the HHS rep, accusing him of hoping that the teenager will die so that his department&#x2019;s budget increases&#x2014;directing the studio audience&#x2019;s ire like an orchestra conductor. As Naylor explains to his young son later, the way to win an argument is not by convincing one&#x2019;s opponent of anything&#x2014;it&#x2019;s by convincing whoever may be watching.</p>



<p>Musk appears similarly enamored with the spectacle of public debate.</p>



<p>Since acquiring Twitter in 2022, he has frequently spoken of the platform as &#x201C;a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner.&#x201D; As tech analyst Ben Thompson wrote in his Stratechery newsletter, though, &#x201C;The digital town square is the internet, broadly; Twitter is more akin to a digital cage match, perhaps best monetised on a pay-per-view basis.&#x201D;</p>



<p>As anyone who has ever been in an argument on that platform can attest, it is somewhere between difficult and impossible to persuade anyone of anything via delayed bouts of point and counterpoint&#x2014;especially when dealing with someone who enjoys arguing before an audience. All that can come of it is circus theatrics, rather than enlightenment, which seems to suit Musk just fine. Off the platform, Musk has aligned himself with &#x201C;Debate me, you coward&#x201D; conservatives like Ben Shapiro, who is always spoiling for an argument he can turn into content&#x2013;and dabbled in some public debating of his own, challenging former Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal in 2022. (What he challenged Mark Zuckerberg to last year was more of a literal cage match, so that doesn&#x2019;t quite count.)</p>



<h2>Everybody is an amoral phony with a price tag</h2>



<p>Nobody believes in anything except the almighty dollar in Thank You for Smoking. Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones&#x2019;s cigarette endorsement can be bought for $25 million, we&#x2019;re told, thanks to a power broker played by Rob Lowe. The righteously pissed, cancer-ridden Marlboro Man, played by Sam Elliott, can be bribed to stop from speaking out against Big Tobacco. And all politicians are susceptible to regulatory capture, like the Washington senator who takes campaign contributions from Boeing, and the Michigan one who accepts them from Ford.</p>



<p>As sultan of spin Nick Naylor puts it, &#x201C;99% of everything done in the world, good or bad, is to pay a mortgage.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Anyone who isn&#x2019;t bought and paid for in the film is at least a hypocrite, like Macy&#x2019;s Vermont Senator who, in the same day, &#x201C;held a press conference calling for American tobacco fields to be slashed and burned, then jumped on a private jet and flew down to Farm Aid, where he drove a tractor onstage as he bemoaned the downfall of the American farmer.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Believing that hypocrisy and bribery run rampant is just healthy skepticism mixed with common sense. But believing that the world exclusively works this way can lead a person to distrust the motives of almost everyone&#x2014;which appears to be where Musk has landed. As he frequently bemoans whatever &#x201C;the woke mind virus&#x201D; is meant to be, the super-CEO acts as though anyone advocating for DEI or ESG only cares about improving their own image, and that all &#x201C;social justice warriors&#x201D; are phony virtue-signalers.</p>



<p>In his world, nobody stands for anything except their own private agenda.</p>



<h2>Journalists are the lowest of the low</h2>



<p>While few if any characters from Thank You for Smoking emerge looking like decent human beings, the true villain of the piece is a journalist played by Katie Holmes. Her Washington-based reporter initiates a sexual relationship with Naylor while researching a story about him, and then uses off-the-record information to pen a juicy hit piece. She even makes a taunting phone call to Naylor after the story runs, just before he is unceremoniously fired.</p>



<p>In a movie about an industry whose product kills over 480,000 people per year, this is the person the audience is most primed to loathe.</p>



<p>Peter Thiel may have been the PayPal mafioso whose media grievances surfaced sooner&#x2014;he was the driving financial force behind Gawker&#x2019;s downfall&#x2014;but Musk appears every bit as hostile toward the fourth estate. After his takeover of the platform in November 2022, he reportedly fired all but one member of its communications team, and soon started auto-replying to press inquiries with the poop emoji. He has since antagonized journalists on the platform, taking away the verification badges that confirmed their identities and conferred a sense of legitimacy, and throttled the shareability of news links in a number of ways.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">press@twitter.com now auto responds with ????</p>&#x2014; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1637420728743088130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Despite being a supposed free-speech absolutist who abhors hypocrisy, Musk has also suspended reporters for vaguely defined reasons multiple times, sued media organizations for reporting on him in a way that might affect his business, and most recently, broke off a deal with Don Lemon to host a show on X after Lemon challenged him during the host&#x2019;s inaugural interview.</p>



<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have to answer these questions,&#x201D; Musk said at one point during that interview. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have to answer questions from reporters. Don, the only reason I&#x2019;m doing this interview is because you&#x2019;re on the X platform and you asked for it. Otherwise, I would not do this interview.&#x201D;</p>



<h2>Do your own research</h2>



<p>&#x201C;Whatever information there is, exists. It&#x2019;s out there. People will decide for themselves. They should. It&#x2019;s not my role to decide for them. It&#x2019;s morally presumptuous.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Those words come from Lowe&#x2019;s Hollywood agent in Thank You for Smoking&#x2013;a character Naylor says he could learn a lot from&#x2013;but they could just as easily be enshrined as the motto of X.</p>



<p>Musk&#x2019;s insistence that his version of Twitter would be a haven for free speech turned out in practice to mean gutting the content moderation and trust and safety departments. The company pledged in January to build a 100-person &#x201C;Trust and Safety Center of Excellence&#x201D; in Austin, but in the meantime, the floodgates are open for hate speech and mis- or disinformation. (During the interview with Lemon, Musk said of X&#x2019;s redline on hate speech, &#x201C;We delete things if they are illegal.&#x201D;) X also remained conspicuously absent from a recent pact among tech companies like Meta, Amazon and Google to put up more guardrails around deepfakes in a pivotal election year.</p>



<p>Perhaps the reason Musk wants to risk mass proliferation of fake news is out of distaste for fact-checkers. Maybe it truly does stem from a desire for unfettered digital liberty. What seems more likely, though, is that he takes trollish glee in the chaos of far-right conspiracy theories&#x2013;like the one he shared in 2022 about the brutal attack on Paul Pelosi&#x2013;and engaging with the people who spread them.</p>



<h2>The moral relativity of preventable deaths</h2>



<p>The climax of Thank You for Smoking is a congressional hearing to determine whether cigarettes should come with more explicit warnings on the packaging. (Little did anyone involved know that cigarette-smoking would become pariah behavior within two decades.) As he has done throughout the film, the protagonist Naylor deflects from the deadliness of cigarettes by bringing up other, less-persecuted products that can also be deadly.</p>



<p>&#x201C;The real demonstrated number one killer in America is cholesterol,&#x201D; he tells Macy&#x2019;s Vermont Senator, &#x201C;and Vermont is clogging this country&#x2019;s arteries with Vermont cheddar cheese.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Although this point could be handily refuted by the weak link on any high school debate team, it lands in the film as an explosive mic-drop. Similarly, Musk seemed to think this same rhetorical flourish was a case-closer when he and Joe Rogan discussed COVID deaths in a May 2020 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience. Neither host nor guest could seem to understand why people were panicking about COVID-19 when so many other deadly dangers lurked all around them. &#x201C;Tylenol also kills a lot of people,&#x201D; Musk noted.</p>



<p>The SpaceX CEO tends not to talk very much about his involvement in Thank You for Smoking these days, though he did cryptically tweet the film&#x2019;s title a couple years ago. He never ended up producing any other mainstream films, nor did Sacks, who currently hosts the All In podcast and moderated Ron DeSantis&#x2019;s rocky presidential campaign launch on Twitter Spaces. Sacks mentioned wanting to do a Thank You spinoff for Rob Lowe&#x2019;s character in a 2006 interview, but nothing ever came of it. Nearly a decade later, Musk tweeted a jokey pitch for a sequel that would presumably be about climate change.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Am thinking of doing a movie &quot;sequel&quot; of sorts to Thank You for Smoking.

</div></figure>



<p>Considering all Musk has said and done in the years since, though, and the fact that he now seems to play down the threat of climate change to avoid ruffling feathers with his ideological cohort, it has become unclear whether Musk makes electric vehicles because he actually cares about carbon emissions or just to pay the mortgage.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Say hello to Charley, the chatbot built to get abortion-seekers the info they need]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As state abortion restrictions started to tighten in the aftermath of the June 2022 decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, two longtime veterans of the fight for abortion access wanted to help.</p>



<p>Former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards and Tom Subak, the nonprofit&#x2019;s former chief strategy officer, wanted to help. They started by conducting a deep dive into the online behavior of abortion seekers both before and after the Supreme Court&#x2019;s ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x2019;s Health Organization. It turned out that a glut of coverage made actually finding abortion resources challenging.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-004-457x457.jpg" alt class="wp-post-91054525 wp-image-91068214" srcset="https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-004-457x457.jpg 457w, https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-004-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-004-150x150.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-004-768x768.jpg 768w, https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-004-100x100.jpg 100w, https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-004.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px"><figcaption>[Image: Charley]</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#x201C;What we didn&#x2019;t expect was that abortion was in the news so much that the search landscape was actually very complicated,&#x201D; Subak says. &#x201C;People were getting results that had nothing to do with how to access an abortion.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Yet, if anything, the need for abortions has risen Though a report from the Society for Family planning found only a modest increase in the number of monthly abortions&#x2014;from 82,115 in July 2022 to 82,298 in June 2023&#x2014;that figure underestimates the number of actual abortions needed, since abortions declined in states where it&#x2019;s illegal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-006-457x457.jpg" alt class="wp-post-91054525 wp-image-91068216" srcset="https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-006-457x457.jpg 457w, https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-006-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-006-768x768.jpg 768w, https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-006-100x100.jpg 100w, https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/wp-cms/uploads/2024/03/91054525-abortion-access-chatbot-006.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px"><figcaption>[Image: Charley]</figcaption></figure>



<p>To help address the gap between the need and availability of abortion resources, in September 2023 Richards and Subak rolled out Charley&#x2014;a chatbot that can be integrated into any website to offer information on abortion access. Charley draws information from INeedAnA.com, which provides clinic information, and the Abortion Policy API for state laws&#x2014;both of which are regularly updated with the latest information on abortions.</p>



<p>&#x201C;Finding information about abortions is currently a scavenger hunt,&#x201D; says Kiana Tipton the executive director of Charley. &#x201C;One of the best ways to get information as quickly as possible is to have a chat bot that does the search for you.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Charley&#x2019;s script, which has been reviewed by healthcare providers and lawyers, directs users through a decision tree where they can find everything from resources on abortion procedures and abortion pills, to helplines where they can talk to someone on the phone about their options. Beyond abortion access info, through its partners and co-creators&#x2014;including Plan C and the M+A Hotline&#x2014;Charley also provides information about accessing funding.</p>



<p>Charley makes it a point not to collect personal data. The bot only asks for zip codes and the date of someone&#x2019;s last period so it can direct people to the relevant local resources. Its data is regularly deleted. &#x201C;The court can subpoena me for Charley&#x2019;s data,&#x201D; said Adele Schieber, the communications director for the National Women&#x2019;s Health Network, &#x201C;But I&#x2019;d have nothing to give them.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The National Women&#x2019;s Health Network is one of 19 websites currently using the free-to-use, donation-funded chatbot, alongside Reproductive Freedom for All and the Abortion Access Front. Subak and Richards made it a point to ensure it was easy to implement&#x2014;people who want to host Charley just have to add a few lines of javascript onto their website.</p>



<p>&#x201C;The hardest part of implementing it, was actually explaining what it was and how it worked to non tech people within our organization and outside of it,&#x201D; Schieber says. Since last September, some 25,000 people have used it, and Schieber notes it is organzation&#x2019;s most popular site page.</p>



<p>Subak noted the most difficult part of designing Charley was understanding the language of an abortion seeker and understanding what there most immediate needs were. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re so steeped in the world of abortions that we use language like in-clinic vs remote or telehealth vs mail, but most people don&#x2019;t get abortions and the people who do get abortions only get one. They&#x2019;re not using the same language.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Going forward, Subak is interested in streamlining the Charley experience. Currently people have to visit a website to chat with Charley and then are redirected to resources outside of Charley. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a lot of jumps,&#x201D; Subak says. &#x201C;We want to make this easier.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Though Schieber says some providers see chatbots like Charley as something that could supplant the advice of real physicians, &#x201C;I see it as elevating their expertise and making sure that it reaches the people who need it. If you provide the best healthcare but no one knows about it, are you really providing healthcare?&#x201D;</p>



<p>Schieber envisions a world where chatbots like Charley are the norm. &#x201C;I want chatbots for how to find birth control and doctors who aren&#x2019;t fatphobic,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Abortion is just the tip of the iceberg.&#x201D;</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Big Tech is tackling rampant election misinformation in non-English-speaking countries—and not just in the E.U.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Warnings about deepfakes and disinformation fueled by artificial intelligence. Concerns about campaigns and candidates using social media to spread lies about elections. Fears that tech companies will fail to address these issues as their platforms are used to undermine democracy ahead of pivotal elections.</p>



<p>Those are the worries facing elections in the U.S., where most voters speak English. But for languages like Spanish, or in dozens of nations where English isn&#x2019;t the dominant language, there are even fewer safeguards in place to protect voters and democracy against the corrosive effects of election misinformation. It&#x2019;s a problem getting renewed attention in an election year in which more people than ever will go to the polls.</p>



<p>Tech companies have faced intense political pressure in countries like the U.S. and places like the European Union to show they&#x2019;re serious about tackling the baseless claims, hate speech and authoritarian propaganda that pollutes their sites. But critics say they&#x2019;ve been less responsive to similar concerns from smaller countries or from voters who speak other languages, reflecting a longtime bias toward English, the U.S. and other western democracies.</p>



<p>Recent changes at tech firms &#x2014; content moderator layoffs and decisions to rollback some misinformation policies &#x2014; have only compounded the situation, even as new technologies like artificial intelligence make it easier than ever to craft lifelike audio and video that can fool voters.</p>



<p>These gaps have opened up opportunities for candidates, political parties or foreign adversaries looking to create electoral chaos by targeting non-English speakers &#x2014; whether they are Latinos in the U.S., or one of the millions of voters in India, for instance, who speak a non-English language.</p>



<p>&#x201C;If there&#x2019;s a significant population that speaks another language, you can bet there&#x2019;s going to be disinformation targeting them,&#x201D; said Randy Abreu, an attorney at the U.S.-based National Hispanic Media Council, which created the Spanish Language Disinformation Coalition to track and identify disinformation targeting Latino voters in the U.S. &#x201C;The power of artificial intelligence is now making this an even more frightening reality.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Many of the big tech companies regularly tout their efforts to safeguard elections, and not just in the U.S. and E.U. This month Meta is launching a service on WhatsApp that will allow users to flag possible AI deepfakes for action by fact-checkers. The service will work in four languages &#x2014; English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.</p>



<p>Meta says it has teams monitoring for misinformation in dozens of languages, and the company has announced other election-year policies for AI that will apply globally, including required labels for deepfakes as well as labels for political ads created using AI. But those rules have not taken effect and the company hasn&#x2019;t said when they will begin enforcement.</p>



<p>The laws governing social media platforms vary by nation, and critics of tech companies say they have been faster to address concerns about misinformation in the U.S. and the E.U., which has recently enacted new lawsdesigned to address the problem. Other nations all-too often get a &#x201C;cookie cutter&#x201D; response from tech companies that falls short, according to an analysis published this month by the Mozilla Foundation.</p>



<p>The study looked at 200 different policy announcements from Meta, TikTok, X and Google (the owner of YouTube) and found that nearly two-thirds were focused on the U.S. or E.U. Actions in those jurisdictions were also more likely to involve meaningful investments of staff and resources, the foundation found, while new policies in other nations were more likely to rely on partnerships with fact-checking organizations and media literacy campaigns.</p>



<p>Odanga Madung, a Nairobi, Kenya-based researcher who conducted Mozilla&#x2019;s study, said it became clear that the platforms&#x2019; focus on the U.S. and E.U. comes at the expense of the rest of the world.</p>



<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a glaring travesty that platforms blatantly favor the U.S. and Europe with excessive policy coddling and protections, while systematically neglecting&#x201D; other regions, Madung said.</p>



<p>This lack of focus on other regions and languages will increase the risk that election misinformation could mislead voters and impact the results of elections. Around the globe, the claims are already circulating.</p>



<p>Within the U.S., voters whose primary language is something other than English are already facing a wave of misleading and baseless claims, Abreu said. Claims targeting Spanish speakers, for instance, include posts that overstate the extent of voter fraud or contain false information about casting a ballot or registering to vote.</p>



<p>Disinformation about elections has surged in Africa ahead of recent elections, according to a study this month from the Africa Center for Strategic Studies which identified dozens of recent disinformation campaigns &#x2014; a four-fold increase from 2022. The false claims included baseless allegations about candidates, false information about voting and narratives that seem designed to undermine support for the United States and United Nations.</p>



<p>The center determined that some of the campaigns were mounted by groups allied with the Kremlin, while others were spearheaded by domestic political groups.</p>



<p>India, the world&#x2019;s largest democracy, boasts more than a dozen languages each with more than 10 million native speakers. It also has more than 300 million Facebook users and nearly half a billion WhatsApp users, the most of any nation.</p>



<p>Fact-checking organizations have emerged as the front line of defense against viral misinformation about elections. The country will hold elections later this spring and already voters going online to find out about the candidates and issues are awash in false and misleading claims.</p>



<p>Among the latest: video of a politician&#x2019;s speech that was carefully edited to remove key lines; years-old photos of political rallies passed off as new; and a fake election calendar that provided the wrong dates for voting.</p>



<p>A lack of significant steps by tech companies has forced groups that advocate for voters and free elections to band together, said Ritu Kapur, co-founder and managing director of The Quint, an online publication that recently joined with several other outlets and Google to create a new fact-checking effort known as Shakti.</p>



<p>&#x201C;Mis- and disinformation is proliferating at an alarming pace, aided by technology and fueled and funded by those who stand to gain by it,&#x201D; Kapur said. &#x201C;The only way to combat the malaise is to join forces.&#x201D;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Not all solar eclipse glasses are created equal. Counterfeits have infiltrated online marketplaces like Amazon]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Americans from Maine to Texas are set for a rare treat on April 8, 2024, when a total solar eclipse will be visible across much of the U.S.</p>
<p>In ancient times, eclipse-viewers thought they were watching the sun be eaten by wolves, a dragon, or a demon.</p>
<p>Of course, we now know that the sun isn&#x2019;t really eaten during an eclipse. Instead, it does what it always does: rain ultraviolet rays on everything in its path. That&#x2019;s why you should never look at a solar eclipse without protective eyewear.</p>
<p>But not just any eyewear will do. To make sure that you enjoy the total solar eclipse safely, the American Astronomical Society has specifically warned against buying eclipse glasses at the lowest price from online marketplaces like Amazon or eBay.</p>
<p>What gives? Why not save a buck on something you&#x2019;ll use possibly just once for a few minutes?</p>
<p>It turns out there&#x2019;s a very good reason: Deceptive counterfeit products have infiltrated retail supply chains. And some of them can pose a threat to your health.</p>
<h2>Invasion of the bogus products</h2>
<p>As experts in supply-chain management, we know that counterfeit products have become a growing problem in recent years.</p>
<p>While counterfeit products can be found at brick-and-mortar shops, they&#x2019;re an especially big problem at online marketplaces. Amazon removed more than 6 million counterfeit items from its supply chain in 2022 alone.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this. First, our recent research shows that consumers often consider the reputation of an online retailer while judging a product&#x2019;s quality. Unscrupulous third-party sellers can take advantage of this fact by selling their wares through a reputable online marketplace.</p>
<p>Another complication arises from the fulfillment services offered by some marketplaces, such as Amazon, where third-party sellers directly send their merchandise to the online retailer&#x2019;s warehouse for shipping and handling. These sorts of fulfillment services offer a little-known benefit to retailers: If a product is running out of stock, they can &#x201C;borrow&#x201D; from a third-party seller&#x2019;s inventory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this also means that a consumer who agrees to buy from one retailer may actually receive merchandise&#x2014;perhaps counterfeit&#x2014;from a third-party seller. While there aren&#x2019;t statistics showing how frequently this happens, there&#x2019;s evidence it&#x2019;s a significant problem.</p>
<p>Thankfully, customers are becoming more aware of counterfeit products and have increasingly pushed online retailers to separate inventories of authorized sellers of merchandise from those that aren&#x2019;t. For instance, Amazon maintains a list of &#x201C;gated&#x201D; brands, such as Asics and Under Armour, that require authorization before they can be sold.</p>
<p>But these protections don&#x2019;t apply across the board. In fact, some counterfeit-prone brands, such as Birkenstock, refuse to sell their products through some online retailers entirely. That leaves an opening for counterfeiters, who tend to offer the lowest prices.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s why the American Astronomical Society recommends eclipse-watchers avoid buying protective glasses from the lowest-price sellers on online marketplaces. And we completely agree. After all, counterfeit sunglasses can be returned, but damage to your eyes is permanent. In 2017, one California man wearing counterfeit eclipse glasses was left with retina damage.</p>
<h2>How to find safe solar eclipse glasses</h2>
<p>If you&#x2019;re in the market for eclipse glasses, it&#x2019;s not hard to get a safe pair. First, buying directly from one of the American Astronomical Society&#x2019;s approved list of brands and manufacturers is the most reliable way. Unfortunately, many of them only sell cheaper, disposable solar eclipse viewers in bulk.</p>
<p>If you need a single pair, your next best option is to purchase one from a major brick-and-mortar chain retailer in person. Many organizations are also handing out free viewers. If you take one, you should make sure it was made by a manufacturer on the American Astronomical Society&#x2019;s list.</p>
<p>If you must buy from an online marketplace, look for evidence of manufacturer authorization. For instance, American Paper Optics&#x2014;an American Astronomical Society-approved brand&#x2014;maintains a list of Amazon sellers approved for reselling their viewers.</p>
<p>What if you&#x2019;ve already bought something from a no-name seller on Amazon? Let&#x2019;s say you bought a pair of sunglasses, or eclipse glasses, with UV protection. It&#x2019;s hard to verify UV protection properties. Sure, there are standards and certifications such as UV400 and ISO 12312-2, but as you have probably guessed, even those can be faked. For instance, you can easily buy entire rolls of UV400 stickers online.</p>
<p>Thankfully, most local opticians can test your sunglasses&#x2019; UV protection properties in seconds. In other words, when in doubt, verify.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This New Orleans museum uses AI to allow visitors to speak with WWII veterans]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Olin Pickens sat in his wheelchair facing a life-size image of himself on a screen, asking it questions about being taken prisoner by German soldiers during World War II. After a pause, his video-recorded twin recalled being given &#x201C;sauerkraut soup&#x201D; by his captors before a grueling march.</p>



<p>&#x201C;That was a Tuesday morning, February the 16th,&#x201D; Pickens&#x2019;s on-screen likeness answered. &#x201C;And so we started marching. We&#x2019;d walk four hours, then we&#x2019;d rest 10 minutes.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Pickens is among 18 veterans of the war and its support effort featured in an interactive exhibit that opened Wednesday at the National WWII Museum. The exhibit uses artificial intelligence to let visitors hold virtual conversations with images of veterans.</p>



<p>Pickens, of Nesbit, Mississippi, was captured in Tunisia in 1943 as U.S. soldiers from the 805th Tank Destroyer Battalion were overrun by German forces. He returned home alive after spending the rest of the war in a prison camp.</p>



<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m making history, to see myself telling the story of what happened to me over there,&#x201D; said Pickens, who celebrated his 102nd birthday in December. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m so proud that I&#x2019;m here, that people can see me.&#x201D;</p>



<p>The Voices From the Front exhibit also enables visitors to the New Orleans museum to ask questions of war-era home-front heroes and supporters of the U.S. war effort&#x2014;including a military nurse who served in the Philippines; an aircraft factory worker; and Margaret Kerry, a dancer who performed at USO shows and, after the war, was a model for the Tinker Bell character in Disney productions.</p>



<p>Four years in the making, the project incorporates video-recorded interviews with 18 veterans of the war or the support effort&#x2014;each of them having sat for as many as a thousand questions about the war and their personal lives. Among the participants was Marine Corps veteran Hershel Woodrow &#x201C;Woody&#x201D; Wilson, a Medal of Honor winner who fought at Iwo Jima, Japan. He died in June 2022 after recording his responses.</p>



<p>Visitors to the new exhibit will stand in front of a console and pick who they want to converse with. Then, a life-size image of that person, sitting comfortably in a chair, will appear on a screen in front of them.</p>



<p>&#x201C;Any of us can ask a question,&#x201D; said Peter Crean, a retired Army colonel and the museum&#x2019;s vice president of education. &#x201C;It will recognize the elements of that question. And then using AI, it will match the elements of that question to the most appropriate of those thousand answers.&#x201D;</p>



<p>The exhibit bears similarities to interactive interviews with Holocaust survivors produced by the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation, founded by film director Stephen Spielberg. That project also uses life-size projections of real people that appear to respond to questions in real time. They&#x2019;ve been featured for several years at Holocaust museums across the U.S.</p>



<p>Aging veterans have long played a part in personalizing the experience of visiting the New Orleans museum, which opened in 2000 as the National D-Day Museum. Veterans often volunteered at the museum, manning a table near the entrance where visitors could talk to them about the war.</p>



<p>But that practice has diminished as the veterans age and die. The COVID-19 pandemic was especially hard on the WWII generation, Crean said.</p>



<p>Theodore Britton Jr., who served during the war as one U.S. Marine Corps&#x2019; first Black recruits, said he was thrilled to help the museum &#x201C;do by mechanical devices what we&#x2019;re not going to be around to do in the future.&#x201D;</p>



<p>The 98-year-old veteran, who later was appointed U.S. ambassador to Barbados and Grenada by then-President Gerald Ford, got a chance Wednesday to question his virtual self, sitting onscreen wearing the Congressional Gold Medal that Britton was awarded in 2012.</p>



<p>&#x201C;There are fewer and fewer World War II veterans, and a lot of people who will never see one,&#x201D; Britton said. &#x201C;But they can come here and see and talk with them.&#x201D;</p>



<p>The technology isn&#x2019;t perfect. For example, when Crean asked the image of veteran Bob Wolf whether he had a dog as a child, there followed an expansive answer about Wolf&#x2019;s childhood&#x2014;his favorite radio shows and breakfast cereal&#x2014;before he noted that he had pet turtles.</p>



<p>But, said Crean, the AI mechanism can learn as more questions are asked of it and rephrased. A brief lag time after the asking of the question will diminish, and the recorded answers will be more responsive to the questions, he said.</p>



<p>The Voices From the Front interactive station was unveiled Wednesday as part of the opening of the museum&#x2019;s new Malcolm S. Forbes Rare and Iconic Artifacts Gallery, named for an infantry machine gunner who fought on the front lines in Europe. Malcom S. Forbes was a son of Bertie Charles Forbes, founder of Forbes magazine. Exhibits include his Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and a blood-stained jacket he wore when wounded.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CrowdTangle’s former CEO has questions about Meta’s decision to close the research tool in an election year]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Meta announced this month that in August it will be closing CrowdTangle, the platform monitoring tool the company bought in 2016. The tool, which tracks the top performing links posted on Meta&#x2019;s platforms, has been deprioritized by Meta&#xA0;for years and victim of various internal reorganizing efforts.</p>



<p>Meta says that CrowdTangle will be replaced by two new tools, Meta Content Library and Content Library API, which the company says &#x201C;provide useful, high-quality data to researchers.&#x201D; But the move has also been criticized by many online researchers, including Brandon Silverman, cofounder and former CEO of CrowdTangle. Silverman signed an open letter this week put together by Mozilla, for whom he works as an advisor, asking that Meta reconsider its decision, given the number of elections happening worldwide this year. The Mozilla letter raised the ire of Meta spokesman Andy Stone, who engaged in a heated back-and-forth with Silverman on X.</p>



<p>Fast Company spoke to Silverman about his thoughts on the closure of CrowdTangle, and why he thinks Meta&#x2019;s alternative isn&#x2019;t a like-for-like replacement. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p>



<p>What was the founding principle of CrowdTangle?</p>



<p>CrowdTangle was originally founded as a community organizing tool. As with a lot of startups trying to find product-market fit, we ended up stumbling on a much better opportunity in 2012 and 2013: to help publishers understand the flow of information across Facebook and social media more broadly.</p>



<p>We unlocked all these other insights that kind of pulled back the curtain on the flow of information inside social media platforms, which at that time was just becoming more and more important to the publishing world.</p>



<p>In recent years, some would say that CrowdTangle has been neutered by limiting new signups and restricting data. Do you think it still serves that purpose today?</p>



<p>We were acquired by Facebook in late 2016. And the idea was that it was a part of a larger commitment they were making to the entire industry. They actually started a whole news-product team that had never existed. Instead of charging for it, they made it free to the entire news industry, and gave us the green light to just go work with and support as many global news partners across the world as we possibly could.</p>



<p>But one thing happened about two years into our acquisition: We just began to get more and more requests from outside of the news industry, from human rights organizations, civil rights and civil society groups, election protection groups. These platforms were also getting really, really important to the work they were doing. And so it was about two years after we got acquired that actually, instead of just having this founding principle of helping serve the global news industry, we took on this broader mandate of trying to be one of the main ways that Facebook was transparent with the outside world about what&#x2019;s happening on the platform.</p>



<p>What do you make of Meta&#x2019;s decision to close it?</p>



<p>It&#x2019;s not surprising. A lot of us who&#x2019;ve been following this closely, I think had a sense that they were getting less interested in providing this sort of transparency. When I left, two years ago, one of the big conclusions and takeaways I had from the entire experience is that private companies and tech platforms are only going to go so far when it comes to their transparency efforts.</p>



<p>I actually give Meta a lot of credit. They invested in us and gave us a ton of resources to go and do this work. By the time I left, I believe there was disagreement about how much farther Facebook wanted to go with this work. But also, there was just still so little effort happening across the rest of the industry, that one of my main takeaways was just, we&#x2019;re only going to make so much progress in this whole space, through voluntary efforts.</p>



<p>We&#x2019;ve actually made a lot of progress in Europe around the Digital Services Act, and something called Article 40. There&#x2019;s a provision sometimes called the &#x201C;CrowdTangle provision&#x201D; because it took some of the model that we have built and said, &#x201C;Hey, this should be one of the ways that we require companies to be transparent.&#x201D; I think Meta would have probably shut down CrowdTangle sooner without that regulation. And I don&#x2019;t think they would have built a replacement.</p>



<p>Do you think the replacement tools they&#x2019;re offering do the same thing as CrowdTangle?</p>



<p>I think there are some things about the Meta Content Library that are way better than CrowdTangle. At its core, its infrastructure has the potential to power a much more comprehensive, robust solution. It also has some data points that we did not have. But there&#x2019;s also some data points that are missing.</p>



<p>And then there&#x2019;s also a ton of missing functionality. One of the main things I learned after doing 10 years of this work, if you&#x2019;re trying to provide meaningful transparency, if you are genuinely trying to support civil society groups, election projects, organizations, you can&#x2019;t just dump what is essentially an infinite amount of data onto their plates and expect them to be able to do anything with it. The functionality and the usability of data is almost as important in some ways as how much data you have. And that&#x2019;s where the Content Library is lacking.</p>



<p>Which is why you waded in over Andy Stone&#x2019;s comments.</p>



<p>Yeah. One of the things that I pointed out is, who gets access, and what does that look like? I think the Content Library could absolutely be a replacement. But at the moment, it&#x2019;s not, and isn&#x2019;t going to be by August 14. That&#x2019;s why I think so many election groups are worried, especially during a year in which we know how many important elections are happening and we know misinformation and disinformation is likely to be a problem.</p>



<p>What do you worry could go wrong this year without CrowdTangle?</p>



<p>There&#x2019;s three things I worry about the most. One is AI-generated content. Parts of Facebook are already starting to be flooded with AI-generated comments and content, and I don&#x2019;t think we exactly know what impact that might have on elections.</p>



<p>The second one is, a lot of these platforms have reduced their investment in election-integrity work. A lot of people who worked on integrity and trust and safety teams inside these platforms are worried about a lot of work that they saw having an impact not existing anymore.</p>



<p>The third one is, listen, I&#x2019;m a U.S. citizen. We&#x2019;re about to have a replay of the last presidential cycle in which one of the candidates was&#x2014;and a significant portion of the media ecosystem supporting him was&#x2014;regularly spreading doubts about the results of the election in a way that eventually resulted in violence at our Capitol; and more importantly, undermined the overall credibility of the entire Biden administration because of how many Republicans think he wasn&#x2019;t &#x201C;elected.&#x201D; And I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s any reason to think that&#x2019;s not going to happen again.</p>



<p>We know these things are happening. It seems like we would want more eyes helping mitigate those problems, rather than less.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Disruptive innovation is the key to plastics sustainability]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Plastic plays a critical role in virtually all industries, from agriculture and construction to healthcare and manufacturing. Time magazine has called plastic one of the four materials (along with cement, steel, and ammonia) without which modern societies would not be possible. However, as global production of this cheap, lightweight, and highly versatile material doubled during the past two decades, plastic consumption grew even faster, according to the OECD, creating significant sustainability challenges. Meeting those challenges will require disruptive innovation from companies both large and small.</p>



<p>&#x201C;Many companies are under significant pressure from employees, customers, regulators, and investors to show progress toward sustainability goals,&#x201D; says Paige Marie Morse, sustainability lead at AspenTech, an industrial software provider. &#x201C;For the companies that make plastics, they also feel a responsibility to meet the increasing demand for resources among a growing population, but without sacrificing sustainability.&#x201D;</p>



<h4><strong>KEY TRENDS EMERGING</strong></h4>



<p>Three noteworthy trends in the plastics sustainability movement are legislation and mandates for increased use of recycled content in manufactured products and elimination of single-use plastics, efforts to make packaging more easily recyclable, and growing recognition that mechanical recycling alone will not be enough to meet the growing demand for recycled raw materials, says Kevin Quast, global&#xA0;&#xA0;business lead for Honeywell&#x2019;s plastics circularity business.</p>



<p>Honeywell UOP, which develops technology and processes for the petrochemical industry, has been an innovator for more than a century. &#x201C;We have been known for helping our customers transform and transition as society, technology, and regulatory environments have evolved,&#x201D; Quast says. &#x201C;We are not just focused on plastics circularity, we are investing in and commercializing solutions for energy storage, clean hydrogen and carbon sequestration, as well as green and renewable fuels, bioplastics, and other areas related to circularity, sustainability, and environmental improvement.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Quast notes that about 60% of Honeywell&#x2019;s research and development (R&amp;D) budget goes toward creating sustainability solutions, such as its&#xA0;UpCycle Process Technology. This new technology expands the types of plastics that can be recycled and creates recycled polymer feedstock (RPF), which is then used to make recycled plastics with a lower carbon footprint.</p>



<h4><strong>SIZE DOESN&#x2019;T MATTER&#xA0;</strong></h4>



<p>Plastics circularity is on the radar of most companies these days, regardless of size or where on the plastics chain they reside. Jay Baker, CEO of Jamestown Plastics, a contract packaging business based in Brocton, New York, is responding to sustainability trends by proactively assuming responsibility, before regulation demands it, he says. For example, he recently developed a circularity option to keep the plastic trays used by one of his customers out of the landfill.</p>



<p>&#x201C;We collect the old trays, grind them up, and send them back to the extruder,&#x201D; Baker explains. &#x201C;The extruder then makes &#x2018;new&#x2019; recycled material, and we use that material to form recycled plastic trays for this customer and keep those expended trays out of the waste stream for as long as possible.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Across the country in Palo Alto, California&#x2014;and at the other end of the size spectrum&#x2014;HP is taking multiple steps to improve its plastics circularity. &#x201C;The elimination of unnecessary plastic is the first priority when it comes to our circularity strategy,&#x201D; says James McCall, HP&#x2019;s chief sustainability officer. &#x201C;As of 2021, we achieved a 44% reduction in single-use plastic packaging, towards our 2025 goal of a 75% reduction compared to 2018.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Additionally, HP has committed to a goal of using 30% post-consumer recycled plastic across its personal systems and print product portfolio by 2025, and it aims to achieve 75% circularity for its products and packaging by 2030.</p>



<h4><strong>WORLDWIDE CONCERN</strong></h4>



<p>Plastics sustainability is a global challenge requiring global solutions, of course. Braskem, an international petrochemical company headquartered in Sao Paulo, Brazil, is working with other innovation leaders around the world to do just that. &#x201C;We believe that the transition from a linear to a circular economy is&#xA0;key to driving sustainable development in the plastics production chain,&#x201D; says Ant&#xF4;nio Queiroz, vice president of innovation, technology, and sustainable development. &#x201C;Promoting sustainable development in our operations is in our DNA. We are consistently focused on developing sustainable solutions that improve people&#x2019;s lives through chemicals and plastics.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Braskem has committed to a 15% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to becoming a carbon neutral company by 2050. It was the first company in the petrochemical industr y to develop a large-scale biopolymer from sugar cane, and it develops partnerships focused on both mechanical and advanced recycling. It has multiple ventures underway in its home country, the latest being Cazoolo, an innovation hub to help customers, brands, designers, startups, and universities develop more sustainable packaging in an effort to improve plastics circularity and reduce environmental impact.</p>



<p>Braskem is also partnering with&#xA0;like-minded enterprises around the world in its push for plastics sustainability. Its investment in U.S.-based Nexus Circular, an advanced recycling company, is part of its effort to expand its circular polymer portfolio. Such collaborations have helped in Braskem&#x2019;s development of two new polypropylene grades with post-consumer recycled (PCR) content that can be used in a wide range of FDA food contact applications.</p>



<h4><strong>BETTING ON INNOVATION</strong></h4>



<p>&#x201C;We know that in order to achieve real sustainability, we also need to bet on innovation when creating new business,&#x201D; says Queiroz. Braskem increased its R&amp;D budget by 50% this year, and it maintains multiple centers for disruptive innovation in Brazil and the U.S. It has partnered with Danish company Topsoe to develop a greener version of MEG, a component for producing PET plastic bottles that is widely used in plastics manufacturing. Derived directly from sugars, this green MEG has the potential to disrupt the polyethylene value chain as it significantly improves its carbon footprint.</p>



<p>&#x201C;We believe transformation is everywhere,&#x201D; says Queiroz. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s time to use our potential to establish a new relationship with our ecosystem and tackle climate change as our planet&#x2019;s greatest challenge. We understand that the more people and organizations are engaged, the more we can do to build a better world for current and future generations.&#x201D;</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Kate Middleton&#8217;s cancer diagnosis underscores the pernicious nature of online conspiracy theories]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Kate Middleton announced on Friday she has been diagnosed with cancer. In a video statement published simultaneously across social and traditional media, Middleton explained that traces of cancer had been discovered following abdominal surgery earlier this year.</p>



<p>The statement is an intensely personal one&#x2014;and one that the Princess of Wales may well have felt she had to make by dint of her status as the U.K.&#x2019;s queen-in-waiting. But the last few weeks of social media hysteria have made it even more important that she share her diagnosis.</p>



<p>The Royal Family, which traditionally takes an attitude of &#x201C;never complain, never explain,&#x201D; has been forced to rapidly rewrite that approach as unchecked rumors swirled of marital infidelity, serious crimes, and even more dramatic health issues. At the same time, the viral effects of social media have collided head-on with a generative AI-born skepticism of photographic evidence that the palace tried to supply in order to calm people&#x2019;s nerves on social media and show that Middleton is indeed alive and well.</p>



<p>Friday&#x2019;s announcement ought to silence the online chatter and stop some of the more outlandish theories that have been posted without a care for the humans at the heart of the subject. Cancer affects one in two people. It is an intensely personal journey, and one that takes fortitude to fight. But when you&#x2019;re in a highly public position, and millions of people are speculating wildly, without evidence, on your public absence, it seems you have to waste time stopping rampant conjecture when you should be focused on what&#x2019;s sure to be a difficult treatment.</p>



<p>The Royal Family have made several media-management mistakes over the past few weeks in handling the scandal around the Princess of Wales. They&#x2019;ve been outpaced and outdone by social media sleuths. And undoubtedly, some will continue to speculate without any kind of evidence. The problem with conspiracy theories is that even when presented with evidence, it&#x2019;s not enough for some.</p>



<p>But social media speculators ought to reflect on the past few weeks and consider whether it was worth it. Because a mother of three now has to fight the toughest battle she&#x2019;s likely to face. It would be nice if she didn&#x2019;t need to worry about social media chatter too.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Ukraine&#8217;s tech sector has proved resilient in wartime. Women&#8217;s startups have offered hope]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>War in Ukraine has pushed women into more leadership roles in its growing tech sector, where they are gaining experience and contacts abroad that could help rebuild the economy when the conflict ends, some entrepreneurs, companies, and investors say.</p>



<p>With most men unable to leave Ukraine, women tech entrepreneurs like Anna Lissova, 30, who runs mental health startup Pleso Therapy, have taken charge of raising funds, finding new clients abroad and embracing other key roles.</p>



<p>Before the war she focused on recruiting therapists in Ukraine. Now she travels abroad to pitch the company at conferences and has led product launches in Poland and Romania.</p>



<p>&#x201C;I had to suddenly change my role and take over the public representation of the company. The war led to women taking more senior positions and power in startups,&#x201D; she said.</p>



<p>Martial law prohibits most men of military age from leaving the country, creating a need and space for female tech entrepreneurs at home and abroad. They are able to build on a stronger representation by women in leadership positions in Ukraine than in the European Union and globally.</p>



<p>Some say they still face prejudice in the traditionally male-dominated tech industry however, or describe their struggles to run a business while adapting to life as a refugee and having to raise families alone with fathers still in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Ukraine has boasted one of eastern Europe&#x2019;s fastest growing tech hubs with startups attracting funding and clients from a large domestic market.</p>



<p>Women were underrepresented however, making up only around 30% of managers in the professional, scientific and technical sector, whereas they occupied 40% of leadership positions in Ukraine overall in 2017-2022, according to a study by the United Nations Development Programme.</p>



<p>The study highlighted that the proportion of Ukrainian women leaders nonetheless outstripped a figure of 35% for the European Union and 29% globally.</p>



<p>Separate figures by Eurostat show around 17% of major tech jobs are held by women in the European Union.</p>



<p>Reuters spoke to nearly a dozen venture capitalists, tech founders and industry officials to document the critical&#x2014;and often new&#x2014;roles women have played in driving a sector seen as key to Ukraine&#x2019;s economic prospects when the war ends.</p>



<p>&#x201C;Women&#x2019;s leadership within the tech sector has become more pronounced after the full-scale invasion,&#x201D; said Pavlo Kartashov, director of the Ukrainian Startup Fund (USF), a government-backed body that seeds startups.</p>



<p>&#x201C;We have witnessed a surge of female entrepreneurs who have stepped up to lead their companies and are driving growth.&#x201D;</p>



<p>This rings especially true for ambitious startups looking to grow abroad, as many that have stayed in Ukraine focus on military or war-related technology such as drones, he added.</p>



<h2>Tech resilience</h2>



<p>The tech sector has proved resilient. While Ukraine&#x2019;s GDP plummeted nearly 30% in 2022, tech sector revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $7.97 billion and was forecast to increase to $8 billion in 2023, according to state statistics compiled by the Lviv Tech Cluster.</p>



<p>The industry also accounts for nearly 5% of Ukraine&#x2019;s GDP with the number of tech specialists inside and outside Ukraine rising to 307,000 in 2023 from 285,000 in 2022. These numbers include the Lisbon-based founder of digital currency payment platform GeekPay.</p>



<p>Veronica Korzh, who founded the startup three months after leaving Ukraine in February 2022, has witnessed a leap in female founders, due in part to increased access to investors outside Ukraine and accelerator programs targetting women funded by the EU, international bodies and tech multinationals.</p>



<p>Many global bodies are out to boost women&#x2019;s representation in tech across the board, amid research showing firms with a higher proportion of women are more profitable, spend more on research and development and are more environmentally-minded, according to a report by the World Economic Forum.</p>



<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen more women starting companies after the war and taking on bigger positions because they can talk to investors and help develop brands to new customers,&#x201D; Korzh said.</p>



<p>&#x201C;This is also helping keep attention on Ukraine and spreading the word about the potential of its tech sector.&#x201D;</p>



<p>For many tech workers, Poland is a first stop as it borders Ukraine and the countries have long business and cultural ties.</p>



<p>Mykhailo Khaletskyi of the Polish-Ukrainian Startup Bridge&#x2014;a group that provides grants, coworking space, and other assistance said: &#x201C;We see women driving new funding rounds and gaining experience that will help to establish new companies and attract international talent and funding,&#x201D; he said.</p>



<p>Anastasiia Smyk, 27, an aeronautical engineer, launched her aviation operations management software company Input Soft outside Ukraine in Warsaw, where she tapped a burgeoning refugee tech community. Her product is now used in the United States, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>&#x201C;When talking to male investors, there were questions like, &#x2018;Why were you appointed CEO of this company?&#x2019; or &#x2018;Please share if you have any male business partners,&apos;&#x201D; she said. But she fought against the prejudice.</p>



<p>&#x201C;My job was to find investments, recognition in the global market, and international clients who would become our early adopters, which was not easy for a no-name startup company from Ukraine,&#x201D; Smyk said.</p>



<p>Looking at the startups founded by Ukrainian refugees, she predicts many will return to the country when the war ends and give a huge boost.</p>



<p>&#x201C;I want to return to Ukraine to be part of the rebuilding and revitalization of our country. . . . We are even open to working pro-bono just to see the first civil aircraft in Ukrainian skies as soon as possible,&#x201D; she said.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[DEI is not why &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; is getting worse]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Pity the die-hard Star Wars fan. It used to be so easy for them to identify where the series purportedly went wrong. One could summarize it in two simple words: the prequels. At this point, however, the franchise has zoomed out to a galaxy far, far beyond the original trilogy, or even the original trilogy of trilogies, to the point where some of its prequels now have prequels. (And the generation of kids who grew up watching the prequel trilogy have since reclaimed it.)</p>



<p>Of all the explanations for where the franchise might have gone downhill, though, one seems particularly misguided&#x2014;and persistent. It&#x2019;s the same flavor of complaint certain fans have been pushing since the series roared back to life under Disney&#x2019;s stewardship nearly a decade ago. But when it reared its head again this week, in response to the trailer for upcoming Disney+ series, The Acolyte, the backlash took a trendy new form: anti-DEI.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The Acolyte trailer has many of the hallmarks of classic Star Wars. There&#x2019;s a restaurant populated by creatures with unique character designs, like the legendary Mos Eisley cantina. It&#x2019;s got a live-action Wookiee Jedi, which should be big news for Chewbacca-lovers. And it closes by setting up a massive lightsaber battle, against what looks to be a powerful Sith lord. While it doesn&#x2019;t reveal much about The Acolyte&#x2019;s plot, the trailer offers enough details to suggest the show will follow an investigation into some disappearing Jedi. For anyone dying to know more, showrunner Leslye Headland describes it as Frozen meets Kill Bill, conjuring images of vengeful force powers, topped with a generous dollop of blood. All told, a potent mix of possibilities.</p>



<p>When the trailer debuted earlier this week, it broke a Lucasfilm record for most views in a single day, but a substantial portion of those 51.3 million views appear to be hate-watches. As of this writing, the clip has 343k thumbs-down on YouTube, compared with its 163k thumbs-up. (YouTube removed the dislike-count from public view in 2021, but you can still view them via a Chrome extension.) Those down votes are only the tip of a massive disapproval iceberg. Complaints about DEI ruining Star Wars have been flourishing all over social media in the trailer&#x2019;s wake.</p>



<p>Although some of the folks attacking the show swear it&#x2019;s because the trailer suggests it will break Star Wars canon&#x2014;not broken canon!&#x2014;the toxic comment section on the YouTube clip tells a different story. Apart from being created by a woman, Russian Doll cocreator Headland, and starring Amandla Sternberg, who is nonbinary, the trailer comes at a time when Star Wars is already in peak &#x201C;wokelash.&#x201D; Back in January, Oscar-winner Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy announced she&#x2019;d be directing the next film in the Star Wars franchise. (Yes, a whole new trilogy is on the way.) She&#x2019;ll be the first woman, and first woman of color, to take the creative reins on a Star Wars film, and those already enlisted in a war against Disney attacked her for celebrating that.</p>



<p>First of all, the idea that the Star Wars franchise is adhering to a DEI quota is demonstrably false. The live-action Star Wars series preceding The Acolyte on Disney+ may have had plenty of women and people of color as guest directors, but all of those shows were created by white men, mainly Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni. Ditto the upcoming series, Skeleton Crew, which stars Jude Law and premieres this December. All but one of them&#x2014;last summer&#x2019;s Ahsoka, starring Rosario Dawson&#x2014;feature male leads.</p>



<p>The most incredible part about the DEI slander, though, is that what truly has tarnished Star Wars is so thuddingly obvious. It&#x2019;s the same brand dilution that has put Marvel on its Hulk-sized back foot. (Similarly, Marvel has also come under attack for being &#x201C;too woke&#x201D; while it should be under attack for not giving its fans 10 seconds to actually miss it.)</p>



<p>When Disney released The Force Awakens in 2015, it was the beginning of a plan to unveil a new film in the Star Wars saga every year, whether it be part of that just-launched sequel trilogy or a standalone project like 2016&#x2019;s Rogue One. It only took the sub-$400 million relative underperformance of Solo: A Star Wars Story in 2018 to make Disney executives wisely pump the brakes on those side films. One wonders how those same execs reconcile their thinking in that moment with the decision to flood the zone with Disney shows so soon after.</p>



<p>In the not-even-quite-four-and-a-half years since Disney+ launched, the platform has rolled out five big-budget live-action series&#x2014;two of which feature lead characters decked out in Mandalorian armor&#x2014;and three animated ones. It would be impossible to maintain the excitement around this saga with near-constant output, even if these shows were consistent in quality. (They absolutely aren&#x2019;t.) Casual fans might have been thrilled at one point to learn that Ewan McGregor would be coming back to reprise his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi for a new Star Wars TV series, but when it&#x2019;s just another show&#x2014;and an underwhelming one at that&#x2014;who cares? Each new entry in the saga now unavoidably lacks any eventness.</p>



<p>The Acolyte may be the project that gives Star Wars the same creative shot in the arm that the recent, excellent Prey gave the similarly long-in-the-tooth Predator series. It may also be terrible. Anyone who thinks the difference will hinge on &#x201C;diversity,&#x201D; though, reveals their own biases. And for a group of people who seem to identify as science fiction fans, it also displays a breathtaking lack of imagination.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[3 major ways the EU’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple could impact your iPhone]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It&#x2019;ll likely take years before the U.S. government&#x2019;s massive antitrust lawsuit against Apple is resolved&#x2014;but the iPhone maker&#x2019;s troubles with European regulators offer a glimpse of what changes American customers may see down the line.The U.S. lawsuit seeks to stop Apple from undermining technologies that compete with its own apps in areas such as streaming, messaging, and digital payments. The Department of Justice also wants to prevent the tech giant from building language into its contracts with developers, accessory makers, and consumers that lets it obtain or keep a monopoly.These are similar to themes that the European Commission, the bloc&#x2019;s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer, and Apple have been wrangling over for years.EU antitrust watchdogs have launched multiple antitrust cases accusing Apple of violating the 27-nation bloc&#x2019;s competition laws, while also imposing tough digital rules aimed at stopping tech companies from cornering digital markets.Brussels&#x2019; efforts will soon start to have an impact on the way the company does business and the experience iPhone users have in Europe. And the changes could signal what&#x2019;s to come for U.S. Apple users&#x2014;if the Justice Department has its way, at least.Here&#x2019;s a closer look:</p>



<h2>Music streaming</h2>



<p>Music streaming users typically weren&#x2019;t able to pay for their Spotify subscriptions directly through their iPhone apps. They couldn&#x2019;t even be informed by email of subscription prices, promos, and offers by Spotify or other music streaming services. That&#x2019;s because Apple puts tight restrictions on apps that compete with its own Apple Music service.But when Spotify complained to the European Union, antitrust regulators opened a years-long investigation that resulted in an order for Apple to stop such behavior and came with a whopping 1.8 billion euro ($2 billion) fine aimed at deterring the company from doing it again.Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission&#x2019;s competition chief, said Apple&#x2019;s practices were &#x201C;illegal&#x201D; and &#x201C;impacted millions of European consumers who were not able to make a free choice as to where, how, and at what price to buy music streaming subscriptions.&#x201D;</p>



<h2>Payments</h2>



<p>Apple tried to resolve a second EU antitrust case by proposing to let third party mobile wallet and payment service providers access the tap-and-go payment function on its iOS operating system.Apple offered the concession to the European Commission, the bloc&#x2019;s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer, after it accused the company in 2022 of abusing its dominant position by limiting access to its mobile payment technology.The commission had been examining whether Apple Pay&#x2019;s rules require online shops to make it the preferred or default option, effectively shutting out rival payment systems. It had also been investigating concerns that it limits access for rival payment systems to the contactless payment function on iPhones.The commission is still mulling the offer. It has been seeking feedback from &#x201C;interested parties&#x201D; on the proposals before making a decision on the case.</p>



<h2>App stores</h2>



<p>Apple has long maintained that there can be only one app marketplace&#x2014;its own&#x2014;on iPhones and other iOS devices. But a sweeping set of new EU regulations that recently took effect has forced the company to open up its so-called &#x201C;walled garden&#x201D; and allow third-party app stores to compete.The EU&#x2019;s Digital Markets Act is a broad rulebook that targets Big Tech &#x201C;gatekeeper&#x201D; companies with a set of do&#x2019;s and don&#x2019;ts that they&#x2019;ll have to abide by. One of its goals is to break up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into one company&#x2019;s products or services.Under the DMA, tech companies won&#x2019;t be able to stop consumers from connecting with businesses outside their platforms. So Apple has been forced to allow people in Europe to download iPhone apps from stores not operated by the U.S. tech giant&#x2014;a move it&#x2019;s long resisted.In a sign of that reluctance, EU regulators said they wanted to question Apple over accusations that it blocked video game company Epic Games from setting up its own app store. But Apple later reversed course and cleared the way for Fortnite maker Epic to set up its rival app store.&#x2014;-AP journalist Barbara Ortutay contributed to this story.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Donald Trump&#8217;s Truth Social headed to Wall Street?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump&#x2019;s return to the stock market could be right around the corner.All eyes are on a vote scheduled for Friday by shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp., a publicly traded shell company that is looking to merge with the former president&#x2019;s media business. The deal&#x2019;s approval would open the door for Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, whose flagship product is the social networking site Truth Social, to soon begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market in Digital World&#x2019;s place.If the merger is greenlit, which is likely, Trump stands to receive a sizable payout. He would own most of the combined company&#x2014;or nearly 79 million shares. Multiply that by Digital World&#x2019;s current stock price of more $42, and the total value of Trump&#x2019;s stake could surpass $3 billion.The prospect of the deal arrives at a time the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is facing his most costly legal battle to date: a $454 million judgment in a fraud lawsuit.But even if the Digital World merger is approved Friday, Trump wouldn&#x2019;t be able to immediately cash out his windfall, unless some things change, due to a &#x201C;lock-up&#x201D; provision that prevents company insiders from selling newly issued shares for six months.Trump&#x2019;s earlier foray into the stock market didn&#x2019;t end well. Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts went public in 1995 under the symbol DJT&#x2014;the same symbol Trump Media will trade under. By 2004, Trump&#x2019;s casino company had filed for bankruptcy protection and was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.Digital World listed many of the risks its investors face, as well as those of the Truth Social owner, if Trump Media also goes public.One risk, the company said, is that Trump would be entitled to vote in his own interest as a controlling stockholder&#x2014;which may not always be in the interests of all shareholders. Digital World also cited the high rate of failure for new social media platforms, as well as Trump Media&#x2019;s expectation that it would lose money on its operations &#x201C;for the foreseeable future.&#x201D;Trump Media lost $49 million in the first nine months of last year, when it brought in just $3.4 million in revenue and had to pay $37.7 million in interest expenses.Trump Media and Digital World first announced their merger plans in October 2021. In addition to a federal probe, the deal has faced a series of lawsuits leading up to Friday&#x2019;s vote.Truth Social launched in February 2022, one year after Trump was banned from major social platforms including Facebook and Twitter, the platform now known as X, following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He&#x2019;s since been reinstated to both but has stuck with Truth Social as a megaphone for his message.Trump promoted Truth Social in a post on the social media network Thursday evening, saying: &#x201C;TRUTH SOCIAL IS MY VOICE, AND THE REAL VOICE OF AMERICA!!! MAGA2024!!!&#x201D;Trump Media doesn&#x2019;t disclose Truth Social&#x2019;s user numbers. But research firm Similarweb estimates that it had roughly five million active mobile and web users in February. That&#x2019;s far below TikTok&#x2019;s more than two billion and Facebook&#x2019;s three billion&#x2014;but still higher than rivals like Parler, which has been offline for nearly a year but is planning a comeback, or Gettr, which had less than two million visitors in February.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[A deal to bring Google&#8217;s AI to the iPhone carries major questions around money]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This story originally appeared in The Technology Letter and is republished here with permission.</p>



<p>A report Monday by Bloomberg&#x2019;s Mark Gurman, citing unnamed sources, stated that Apple is in talks with Alphabet&#x2019;s Google to bring the latter&#x2019;s artificial intelligence mega-program, Gemini, to the iPhone. Gurman&#x2019;s report raised but did not answer an interesting question, Who pays whom?</p>



<p>Gemini is a recently-released program from Google that can do things similar to OpenAI&#x2019;s ChatGPT, but also a whole lot more, such as finding a particular moment in a video clips based just on the description the user types. The program can be used for free, and Google offers an higher-capability version, called &#x201C;Advanced,&#x201D; as part of a Google subscription that includes storage and Google Docs and other things, for $19.99 per month.</p>



<p>Gurman&#x2019;s report stirred a number of enthusiastic reflections from the Street in the ensuing twenty-four hours. None of those observers can say, however, who is the one paying here.</p>



<p>That question is especially intriguing because Google already has a deal with Apple, which the U.S Department of Justice is suing Google over, to have its search engine be the default on Apple&#x2019;s iOS devices, including the iPhone. That deal involves Google paying Apple an undisclosed sum that analysts have estimated at twenty billion dollars, annually.</p>



<p>In the case of the Gurman report, it&#x2019;s not clear if Google would also pay Apple, or if the reverse would be true.</p>



<p>One view, put forward Tuesday by Merrill Lynch&#x2019;s Alphabet analyst, Justin Post, is that &#x201C;the report did not provide details on potential financial terms, be we assume Apple would be paying Google a technology license fee.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Perhaps, but hold on. Writes Evercore ISI Apple analyst Amit Daryanani, &#x201C;It could be structured similar to the current deal where Google pays a portion of search revenue to Apple in exchange for being the default search option on Safari.&#x201D;</p>



<p>On the other hand, continues Daryanani, &#x201C;We could also see a scenario where Apple is the one paying Google to license these features as it sounds like this could effectively be a white label deal.&#x201D;</p>



<p>And Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi is decidedly down the middle, frankly admitting the aporia: &#x201C;Who would pay whom if Apple and Gemini partnered? Unclear.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Sacconaghi writes that a &#x201C;base case hypothesis is that Apple might pay Google nominally or not at all initially,&#x201D; and then, &#x201C;over time, as AI/voice based revenue models become more clear, we believe that Apple and Google could work out a revenue share agreement, similar to search.&#x201D;</p>



<p>It&#x2019;s possible, he further muses, that Google &#x201C;could subsidize it in order to solidify its relationship with Apple, and get Gemini the rep it needs to be best-in-class,&#x201D; as, &#x201C;We believe that Google has as good a shot as anyone in monetizing AI down the road.&#x201D;</p>



<p>It&#x2019;s fascinating that no one is certain what kind of money is going to develop here: a big-ticket purchase by Apple to try to fill a yawning gap in its capabilities, or a big-ticket payoff by Google to try to round up an audience of two billion Apple users as a way to get ahead of OpenAI and its fiscal backer, Microsoft.</p>



<p>You could say that either scenario seems a bit emblematic of today&#x2019;s &#x201C;generative&#x201D; AI, in that the stuff requires a lot of investment, and it&#x2019;s not entirely clear how to monetize it yet. Google is collecting twenty bucks for Gemini Advanced, the same amount as OpenAI&#x2019;s ChatGPT &#x201C;Plus&#x201D; subscription. Others have aped that pricing, such as startup Perplexity, which is selling subscriptions to its &#x201C;Pro&#x201D; version of its AI chat bot for $20 a month, as an alternative search engine free of the nuisance of advertising.</p>



<p>All of those parties are charging less than the thirty dollars per month that Microsoft is charging for the AI add-on to its productivity apps, Copilot.</p>



<p>In this early phase of Gen AI, the jury is out on whether the stuff is a big cost center, as it might be if Apple is writing a cheque to Google, or a budding profit center, as it might be if Google&#x2019;s actually subsidizing the thing in order to make money &#x201C;down the road,&#x201D; as Sacconaghi suggests.</p>



<p>Gen AI is simply warping the business universe, making opposing business models, and opposing monetization schemes, equally plausible, which means it&#x2019;s interesting times we live in.</p>



<p>On a much smaller scale, analysts were delighted on two counts. One, such a deal, whoever is paying, suggests Google is still in good stead with Apple despite the overhang of a Department of Justice lawsuit. And, two, since Apple is perceived as way behind every other tech giant on AI, it&#x2019;s nice to know that they have options such as Google to help them while they scramble to catch up.</p>



<p>Meantime, the only party sure to be comfortably minting money off of all this is, you guessed it . . . Nvidia.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does AI have a sense of humor?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in January, a lot of people were infuriated by the very idea of a posthumous, AI-generated George Carlin special&#x2014;at least until it turned out to be written by a human. Jeff Ganim was not one of those people. &#x201C;I want to see an AI Jerry Seinfeld cracking jokes in a hundred years about the towels in a hotel on the moon,&#x201D; the AI prompt engineer says.</p>



<p>Ganim&#x2019;s recent creation, PFFT, named after one of the sounds people&#x2019;s lips allegedly make when they find something funny, uses an AI model to dispense The Onion-style headlines based on user prompts. It&#x2019;s the latest in a growing number of tools that rely on machine-learning to generate jokes, including standup chatbot AI Comedian; Punchlines.ai, which provides the kicker to user&#x2019;s setups, and AI Comedy Skit, which generates scripts for decidedly non-SNL caliber sketches out of user-provided premises. But are any of these digital vaudevillians actually pushing the creativity envelope, or are they turning a vital artform into a satire of humanity?</p>



<p>PFFT has a no-frills interface with a bright orange news ticker at the bottom, rattling off previous, humor-adjacent headlines. (&#x201C;Unicorn dies of glitter lung,&#x201D; &#x201C;Study finds every type of parenting produces miserable adults,&#x201D; etc.) A prompt-field dead center solicits users to enter an opinion. Type one in&#x2014;say, &#x201C;Spring is an underrated season&#x201D;&#x2014;hit the &#x201C;Pfft&#x201D; button, and after a brief, buffering throat-clearance, the machine confidently offers a handful of zingers. (Cherry Blossoms&#x2019; Brief, Fleeting Beauty Completely Wasted On Fallible, Stupid Humans, etc.) Users can then keep repeating this process until a joke riffing on that initial opinion produces sufficient guffaws.</p>



<p>Ganim approached the task of building PFFT as both a creative and a comedy lover. The AI prompt engineer, who has a background in digital marketing, provided large language models with ample doses of humor to build the comedy tool. (He would not specify which sources of humor he used.) Ganim was amazed initially by the creative potential of OpenAI&#x2019;s early models, such as davinci-002&#x2014;the AI that reportedly freaked out comedy writer Simon Rich last year with its joke-generating abilities. Ganim felt somewhat stifled by the newer models, which now have more guardrails against overtly offensive output, but pressed on anyway.</p>



<p>Like a road comic tailoring material to different cities, AI could potentially mimic any number of comedic modes. Ganim chose satirical news headlines because AI is especially adept at pattern-recognition and imitation, which he thought made it well-suited for this kind of parody. He describes PFFT as a way to democratize the power of satire for anyone who doesn&#x2019;t feel served by The Onion or The Babylon Bee. However, he also hopes it will inspire other creatives to work with AI and build new kinds of art together. Even comedians.</p>



<p>&#x201C;Comedy writers talk about how difficult comedy writing actually is,&#x201D; Ganim says. &#x201C;Many describe it as, counterintuitively, quite a painful process. I think tools like this can help take away some of the drudgery of comedy writing so comedians can focus on the parts of comedy that they really love.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Curious about how well this tool performed the drudgery of comedy writing, I put it to the test.</p>



<p>&#x201C;Black labs are the best dogs,&#x201D; I wrote into the blinking field hungry for opinions. After a brief wait, the machine shares its work. The vast majority of these headlines are hot garbage. &#x201C;Black Lab Kills Owner in Cold Blood,&#x201D; for instance, is essentially the exact opposite of the prompt I had just entered. Some of the entries, however, stood out in positive ways.</p>



<p>Black Lab Has No Time For Your Bull*hit, Wants To Play Ball, hinges on an amusingly familiar situation. Unfortunately, this joke could apply to most dog breeds. It&#x2019;s cute, but not specific enough. It also telegraphed another issue that became more pronounced in later searches; several headlines rely on an unlikely curse word to do the heavy lifting of making a joke work.</p>



<p>Racist Black Lab Refuses to Chase Own Tail is another that caught my attention, but mainly because I hadn&#x2019;t yet considered how and whether race would factor into PFFT&#x2019;s jokes. (Ganim says his team needs to use OpenAI&#x2019;s moderation filter to comply with the terms of service of the model, preventing it from landing in truly tasteless territory.)</p>



<p>A caption on PFFT&#x2019;s main page suggests experimenting with detail. I flailed around for the type of opinion I might have considered tweeting. Here&#x2019;s what I came up with: &#x201C;When a server at a restaurant asks if you need another minute with the menu, and you say yes, they will always give you way too many minutes.&#x201D;</p>



<p>One of the responses skews close to the tried and true Onion format of framing mundane moments as major news: Waitress Gives You 50 More Minutes to Decide. Another takes a different tact with the same core joke: Server&#x2019;s &#x2018;More Time with the Menu&#x2019; Offer Turns Out to Be for the Rest of the Day. Neither so much as elicits a chuckle, but they do make me smile.</p>



<p>PFFT seems to have a near-competent command of some Onion styles, and at least flicks in the direction of being funny. But is it actually funny? I decided to ask a professional comedian.</p>



<p>Django Gold is a former writer for The Onion and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, who has joked about AI in his recent standup special, Bag of Tricks, which is free to watch on YouTube. Although he has not taken in the full range of comedic AI offerings currently available, Gold disputes the idea that machines can learn what makes jokes funny&#x2014;let alone make funny jokes.</p>



<p>&#x201C;You just know when a joke works. And that knowledge derives from an impossible number of inputs,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;It comes from your own personal experiences, it comes from the audience&#x2019;s experiences, and it also comes from how you interpret the overlap between them. It comes from our shared culture, and it also comes from the way words sound and how their meaning subtly changes when combined in different ways, and&#x2014;when spoken out loud&#x2014;the vocal inflection used to deliver them. And, very often, it comes from the identity of the joke teller and our related expectations.&#x201D;</p>



<p>When a joke comes from a comedian with a well-defined persona, for instance, the audience filters each joke through all the other jokes they&#x2019;ve ever heard from that comedian, along with everything else they know about her or him. (See: Mulaney, John.)</p>



<p>Conversely, AI-generated jokes may instead suffer from the fact that most audiences will experience them in the context of everything they know and feel about AI.</p>



<p>According to Gold, though, the problem is more that the material is not up to par.</p>



<p>&#x201C;PFFT maybe can produce joke elements, little idea-pieces that the machine has correctly identified as occasionally being contained in a joke,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;But the machine can&#x2019;t make them cohere in a meaningful way; it&#x2019;s just throwing them together willy-nilly and presenting this collection of elements as a joke.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Since he hadn&#x2019;t seen any of PFFT&#x2019;s jokes yet at this point, I showed Gold some examples from the headlines it created from my prompts, starting with the one about the racist black lab.</p>



<p>&#x201C;This is technically a joke,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;If a person said this to me, I would smile politely.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Next, I offered one PFFT made based on my opinion about how oranges aren&#x2019;t worth the amount of effort it takes to peel them: &#x201C;Oranges Just a Vibrant, Healthy Way to Get Your Hands Sticky.&#x201D;</p>



<p>We both agreed that the use of the word &#x201C;vibrant&#x201D; seemed almost violently unnatural in this context. I thought the joke was basically okay, though, while Gold felt otherwise.</p>



<p>&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t good, and worst of all it&#x2019;s not good in a very boring way,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Oranges are sticky, that&#x2019;s the &#x2018;nut&#x2019; of the joke here. Not very interesting. How about: Man Takes Break from Peeling Orange to Put in Contact Lenses? Not exactly groundbreaking, but better. More human.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Curious about what PFFT would have to say about Gold&#x2019;s disses, I entered a prompt about a comedy AI making mediocre jokes. It responded with the headline, Comedy AI: 404 Not Funny, which is probably the funniest thing it came up with in the hours I spent noodling with it.</p>



<p>One area where the comedian and the comedy AI tool sync up somewhat is in the idea of comedy as a numbers game. PFFT boasts that while professional comedians may get one in 20 funny bits, it averages one in 10. (Ganim says this statistic is a rough estimate.) Meanwhile, Gold often has to sift through a lot of meh iterations of a joke before getting to a winner. One critical difference between how man and machine approach producing jokes in bulk, though, in Gold&#x2019;s view, is that machines can&#x2019;t distinguish between good and bad jokes.</p>



<p>&#x201C;When writing a bunch of monologue jokes, for example, the idea would be to write 30 and get 10 good ones out of that. And if you wrote 60, those 10 good ones would be stronger than the 10-from-30 batch,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;But one key element of this process is that you learn from the bad jokes and figure out how to improve them. A machine can&#x2019;t teach itself to get closer to a good joke; it just keeps generating material without making adjustments, forever.&#x201D;</p>



<p>It&#x2019;s unclear if PFFT could ever teach itself to be funnier, but its creator would like his machine to do more.</p>



<p>Ganim wants to see PFFT eventually evolve into a new kind of social media site, one where everyone can post their own satirical news based on in-jokes with their friends. He also sees such a place becoming a hub where aspiring comedians can post the material they come up with, start building an audience, and maybe even get discovered. He&#x2019;d also like to work with heavy-hitter marquee comedians and&#x2014;with their permission, of course&#x2014;train custom AI models just for them, turning something like that fake George Carlin AI special into a reality.</p>



<p>&#x201C;People don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s possible to do this in a way that does justice to their creative minds,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;but I think these people are giving up too soon.&#x201D;</p>



<p>For Gold, on the other hand, humanity can&#x2019;t throw in the AI comedy towel fast enough.</p>



<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think AI will ever produce comedy that anyone enjoys or has demand for. If it does, I&#x2019;ll eat my hat,&#x201D; he says, adding: &#x201C;And it&#x2019;s a large, brittle hat.&#x201D;</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The government is funding a project to put a train on the moon]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Out: the train to space. In: the inter-moon-base express.</p>



<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) tapped Northrop Grumman to develop a concept for a lunar railroad, the defense prime contractor announced this week. The contract was awarded under the LunA-10 initiative, which is exploring all sorts of out-there concepts to encourage the growth of a sustainable lunar economy in the next decade.</p>



<p>The company will continue advancing the railroad concept it&#x2019;s been working on in secret since securing the preliminary contract in December. That theoretical railroad would transport people and cargo across the moon&#x2019;s surface.</p>



<h2><strong>All aboard</strong></h2>



<p>It&#x2019;s going to take a village to build a lunar . . . uh . . . village. That&#x2019;s the reasoning behind DARPA&#x2019;s 10-Year Lunar Architecture program, which is intended to de-risk the technologies that could expand the U.S.&#x2019;s capabilities in space and support the growth of a commercial opportunity on the moon.</p>



<ul><li>Other projects selected for the exploratory program&#xA0;<a href="https://payloadspace.com/darpa-awards-luna-10-moon-infrastructure-project-contracts/">include</a>&#xA0;GITAI&#x2019;s inchworm robots, Sierra Space&#x2019;s oxygen-extraction tech, and ICON&#x2019;s 3D printing using lunar regolith.</li><li>A total of 14 companies are participating in the consortium.</li></ul>



<p>Don&#x2019;t get it twisted&#x2014;these projects are by and large in super early stages, and there&#x2019;s no guaranteed path to deployment. Instead, DARPA and the LunA-10 companies are spending their time dreaming big and considering how each contribution would complement the others.</p>



<h2><strong>Full steam ahead</strong></h2>



<p>Now that Northrop has secured a follow-on contract for its train concept, the development continues. The company will continue working with the larger group to think through the railroad&#x2019;s place in the mix of technologies vying for the place in a commercial lunar landscape.</p>



<h2><strong>Planes, trains, and automobiles</strong></h2>



<p>It will take multiple modes of transportation to cover ground on the moon. On April 3, NASA will announce the company or companies selected to build the Lunar Terrain Vehicle that will chauffeur astronauts across the lunar surface.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The DOJ lawsuit isn&#8217;t just about the App Store—it&#8217;s about Apple&#8217;s growing control over everything, starting with your own car]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>President Biden&#x2019;s Department of Justice dropped jaws today by announcing it is suing Apple, accusing the tech heavyweight of operating an &#x201C;iPhone monopoly.&#x201D; The antitrust lawsuit, which was joined by 16 states and the District of Columbia, marks the biggest challenge Apple has seen so far to its industry dominance&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s despite capping what could be called a world-historic past year of legal troubles, involving everyone from fellow tech companies to the European Union.</p>



<p>But rather than focusing on Apple&#x2019;s narrow (mis)conduct with the App Store, as those others have, the Biden DOJ&#x2014;which can now brag it&#x2019;s sued all four of the world&#x2019;s largest tech companies&#x2014;unspools over 88 pages a more bleak set of worries that Apple could come to dominate nearly every entry point into modern digital life, all stemming from its vice grip on the smartphone market.</p>



<p>&#x201C;The strategies Apple has employed to date are not the only ones Apple can use to achieve its anticompetitive and lucrative ends,&#x201D; the lawsuit warns, referring back to the App Store abuse allegations, adding: &#x201C;As technology evolves, Apple continues to evolve and shift its anticompetitive behavior to protect its monopoly power.&#x201D;</p>



<p>As an example, the DOJ mentions Apple&#x2019;s growing litany of subscription services that have spilled into, and therefore compete in, sectors spanning from Hollywood to the media, the wellness industry, and finance. The DOJ claims Apple is actively making the &#x201C;moat around its smartphone monopoly&#x201D; deeper and wider, so that in effect, iPhone owners can&#x2019;t escape. In the agency&#x2019;s eyes, Apple creates services such as Apple Pay, Apple TV, Apple Music, Apple News, Apple Arcade, and Apple Fitness, then uses its ability to write the rules for the App Store and other means to hobble those services&#x2019; competitors. The government argues that subscription services also control the manner in which the audience accesses third-party content, allowing Apple to piggyback on outsiders&#x2019; work &#x201C;as the middleman or tollbooth operator.&#x201D;</p>



<p>To really hammer home its point, the DOJ quotes an untactful line unearthed in Apple&#x2019;s past internal communications. Fears aren&#x2019;t about Apple having to compete in a market where consumers can &#x201C;buy[] a [expletive] Android for 25 bux at a garage sale&#x201D; yet still &#x201C;have a solid cloud computing device.&#x201D; They&#x2019;re about needing a bigger moat to &#x201C;maintain its monopoly through many other products and services.&#x201D;</p>



<p>People have already noted Apple&#x2019;s dominance in smartphones (61.3% of the U.S. market), tablets (57%), and apps ($1.1 trillion generated by App Store users in 2022, enough to be Earth&#x2019;s 18th-largest economy). But the DOJ looks to highlight less-noted areas where Apple could widen that moat. One such area that the agency seemed to find particularly worrisome involves Apple CarPlay.</p>



<p>Apple has told automakers that to function in their vehicles, the next generation of CarPlay must be given permission to &#x201C;take over all the screens, sensors, and gauges in a car, forcing users to experience driving as an iPhone-centric experience if they want to use any of the features provided by CarPlay,&#x201D; the suit says. While Apple technically may no longer be building an electric vehicle&#x2014;&#x201C;CarPlay on steroids&#x201D;&#x2014;to rival Tesla&#x2019;s, it is still going pedal to the metal on a carOS, using an iPhone-compatible info-tainment system as the wedge in. The U.S. government believes it sees a pattern here: &#x201C;Apple leverages its iPhone user base to exert more power over its trading partners, including American carmakers, in future innovation.&#x201D;</p>



<p>And losing control of its own dashboards begs new questions about the car industry&#x2019;s autonomy. What if a driver crashed because their CarPlay glitched, and the vehicle&#x2019;s interactive panels, all at the software&#x2019;s mercy, went blank? Who&#x2019;s responsible in that event? Apple isn&#x2019;t likely to volunteer as legal tribute, which means automakers could find themselves arguing why they&#x2019;re not liable for accidents caused by their own cars.</p>



<p>Accusations that Apple is breaking antitrust laws have revolved for years around the effects on App Store developers, from big players like Epic Games and Spotify down to the other 98% that earn less than $1 million per year. However, Apple&#x2019;s bold CarPlay move may, in fact, have already spooked the American car industry&#x2014;a group the federal government also must protect from anticompetitive conduct. In fact, GM surprised auto enthusiasts last year when it announced sudden plans to stop offering CarPlay in electric vehicles, beginning with the Chevy Blazer EV due out this upcoming fall. Android Auto, the Google rival platform, would also be phased out, and the move could have been read as an attempt to curb both companies&#x2019; growing appetite&#x2014;only GM said it&#x2019;s introducing a built-in info-tainment system codesigned by none other than Google. Apple&#x2019;s CarPlay power grab may have simply given it the shivers.</p>



<p>And that concerns the government. &#x201C;When one road is closed to Apple,&#x201D; it says in the lawsuit, &#x201C;Apple has demonstrated its ability to find new roads to the same or worse ends.&#x201D; Less of a tech pioneer these days, the giant company now faces less competition, the Biden administration argues, &#x201C;not because Apple makes its own products better but because it makes other products worse,&#x201D; from news sites to video games and, potentially, your car.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The UN finds rare consensus on a new AI safety resolution]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations general assembly has passed (with the notable support of China) a resolution promoting the safe development of AI around the world. The resolution is non-binding, but symbolizes a heightened global concern about the potential risks of the burgeoning technology.</p>



<p>The resolution was sponsored by the United States, which worked for months on the wording to gain the support of China, Russia, Cuba, and other countries less friendly to the U.S. The U.S. and China are considered the world&#x2019;s biggest developers of new AI, and the rivalry has exacerbated the tensions between the two countries.</p>



<p>&#x201C;In a moment in which the world is seen to be agreeing on little, perhaps the most quietly radical aspect of this resolution is the wide consensus forged in the name of advancing progress,&#x201D; U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during a speech to the assembly prior to the vote.</p>



<p>The new resolution &#x201C;reaffirms&#x201D; several past UN declarations on the subject, including an agreement among UN member countries back in 2015 to work together toward 17 responsible development goals by 2030. But the countries most active in developing AI have strayed from those commitments.</p>



<p>The resolution is aimed at nonmilitrary AI systems. It sets guidelines to ensure that AI systems in all stages of development and deployment are &#x201C;human-centric, reliable, explainable, ethical, inclusive; in full respect, promotion and protection of human rights and international law, privacy preserving, sustainable development-oriented, and responsible . . .&#x201D; the resolution states.</p>



<p>The resolution also represents the first time an effort was made to include the voices of Global South countries in discussions of global safety standards.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Biden’s Big Tech lawsuits showcase his populist side]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice and 16 state attorneys general brought a wide-ranging antitrust lawsuit against Apple for abusing its monopoly in the smartphone market.</p>



<p>The complaint lays out a series of alleged abuses: Apple has unfairly limited access to its popular iOS platform, blocked out certain app developers, and prohibited key functionality that could make its service better for users or give them more choice. It even took aim at the infamous green bubbles that appear when iPhone owners deign to text Android users.</p>



<p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, will likely take years to resolve if it even goes to trial, but it&#x2019;s far from an isolated assault: Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration&#x2014;through two executioners, Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter and Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan&#x2014;has wielded federal antitrust law as a blunt weapon to whack Big Tech&#x2019;s most ubiquitous firms. In this way, it&#x2019;s Biden at his most populist&#x2014;pushing to bring lower prices and better services to the people.</p>



<p>The internet economy has mandated a rethinking of traditional antitrust enforcement. Long since the storied days of post-industrial trust-busting in the early decades of the 20th century, the cases we see today largely concern free or super-cheap services subsidized by advertising. That&#x2019;s not exactly the case for the Apple suit, with regulators outlining the ways in which Apple&#x2019;s decisions and policies directly lead to price increases for consumers. But much of the complaint has to do with the steady worsening of services&#x2014;either because of Apple&#x2019;s market power or as a means of maintaining its chokehold on the powerful ecosystem it built. The writer Cory Doctorow calls this phenomenon &#x201C;enshittification,&#x201D; though the more-PG term &#x201C;platform decay&#x201D; also works.</p>



<p>Indeed, platform decay has been an element of nearly every antitrust suit levied against Big Tech firms in the Biden administration: When the FTC sued Amazon in September 2023, it harped on the degradation of the e-commerce site, which it found littered with Amazon-made products and and sponsored results. The Justice Department made similar arguments at trial against Google this fall, claiming the Mountain View giant was making its search results worse and flooding the system with ads. (The Trump administration originally filed that suit, but it was continued by Biden administration prosecutors.) Surely, the quality of these free-or-cheap-platform companies will be at play when the government faces off with Google in court over its advertising technology in September, and possibly when it goes to court against Meta for anticompetitive mergers with Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>



<p>The era of unbridled and unquestioned growth for Big Tech companies is over. Mergers and acquisitions are as scrutinized as ever, and the U.S. government is dead set on making tech companies pay for the alleged abuses of their station. It&#x2019;s up to the judges now to decide whether these companies have soiled their platforms enough in the name of maintaining power that something has to change.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Reddit’s WallStreetBets weighs in on the company’s IPO, as the stock pops in early trading]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Reddit shares busted out of the gate Thursday, showing an immediate gain of more than 60% as the long-awaited initial public offering finally turned the social media site into a publicly traded company.</p>



<p>Shares opened at $47 each&#x2014;and quickly jumped to $55. The question is: Can the company hold (and build upon) those gains?</p>



<p>Reddit has warned investors that there are a number of factors that could impact its stock. It&#x2019;s not a profitable company and user bases are fickle things that could disappear without a lot of warning. But one of the most curious risks it mentioned was its own users.</p>



<p>In its IPO filing, Reddit cited its own r/wallstreetbets community could be problematic, writing, &#x201C;Given the broad awareness and brand recognition of Reddit . . . the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could experience extreme volatility for reasons unrelated to our underlying business or macroeconomic or industry fundamentals.&#x201D;</p>



<p>So as Reddit begins its next phase as a publicly traded company, what is the WSB crowd saying about it?</p>



<p>It was, as you might expect, a little bit of everything. WallStreetBets rarely agrees on anything completely, with some notable exceptions, such as driving up the price of meme stocks like GameStop and AMC and their disdain for hedge fund companies. But there were some underlying themes.</p>



<p>Several WSB users showed off their purchase orders for Reddit shares, as the company offered its users and moderators the opportunity to purchase a sizable percentage of its shares at IPO prices, something that&#x2019;s usually restricted to institutional investors. They did so with a sense of humor (and a bit of trepidation), with such thread titles as &#x201C;Caviar or Wendy&#x2019;s dumpster tonight boys&#x201D; and &#x201C;Hold onto your butts.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Other users offered congratulations, shouted warnings, and just had fun at the company&#x2019;s expense. The big question is: Will those users &#x201C;hold&#x201D; the stock&#x2014;or pump and dump it?</p>



<p>Here are a few of the comments that stood out.</p>



<p>&#x201C;My guess is it will go like Roblox, a bit of hype rising to $50$-$70 at most then fall down to 15-$20,&#x201D; said one Redditor.</p>



<p>&#x201C;I seriously hope you have many millions and this was just to troll. Your assets will likely depreciate by 20k next week,&#x201D; another user warned a Reddit stock buyer.</p>



<p>&#x201C;Somebody name an IPO than didn&#x2019;t 1/2 in 6 months,&#x201D; noted another.</p>



<p>One user poked a little fun at WSB&#x2019;s history of pumping up stocks, pleading with fellow Redditors, &#x201C;Hey guys how about not shorting reddit but phaumpin it to $500 so we can all get Lambos and leave reddit?? Don&#x2019;t mess this up for me . . . &#x201D;&#x201C;Reddit deserves nothing more than to be pumped and dumped,&#x201D; countered another.</p>



<p>One Redditor voiced the frustration of many users who weren&#x2019;t allocated the number of shares they had requested, saying &#x201C;BACK UP THE TRUCK BOYS! I&#x2019;VE BEEN ALLOCATION A SHARE. YES, A SHARE. A SINGLE SHARE. ONE.&#x201D;</p>



<p>One Reddit user who&#x2019;s not complaining or snark posting? CEO Steve Huffman, whose 368,954 Class A shares boosted his net worth by more than $500 million.</p>]]></description>
