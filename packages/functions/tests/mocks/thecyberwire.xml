            <description>The Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) (NIST Special Publication 800-181, revision 1) provides a set of building blocks for describing the Tasks, Knowledge, and Skills (TKS) that are needed to perform cybersecurity work by individuals or teams. Through these building blocks, the NICE Framework enables organizations to develop their workforces to perform cybersecurity work, and it helps learners to explore cybersecurity work and to engage in appropriate learning activities to develop their knowledge and skills. On this Special Edition podcast, N2K CyberWire's Dave Bittner is joined by the team at NIST and FIU's Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy to delve into the history of the NICE Framework through its latest update and looking into the future. Brian Fonseca, Director at the Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy, shares an introduction to the NICE Framework. Karen Wetzel, NICE Framework Manager, discusses the updates to the framework. Rodney Petersen, Director of NICE, talks about what these updates mean to cybersecurity education's future.</description>

            <description>Robert Duncan from Netcraft is sharing their research on "Phishception - SendGrid abused to host phishing attacks impersonating itself." Netcraft has recently observed that criminals abused Twilio SendGrid’s email delivery, API, and marketing services to launch a phishing campaign impersonating itself. Hackers behind this novel phishing campaign used SendGrid’s Tracking Settings feature, which allows users to track clicks, opens, and subscriptions with SendGrid. The malicious link was masked behind a tracking link hosted by SendGrid.</description>
